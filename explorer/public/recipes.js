// Fixed recipe list for Catchment Lake — worked queries against tables that
// are live today (anonymous read): geography.unit, measure.observation,
// measure.definition, measure.stratum, provenance.release. Every SQL string
// here is self-contained (INSTALL/LOAD/ATTACH included) so pasting one
// verbatim into desktop DuckDB works with no setup.
//
// Verified live against the catalog on 2026-09-18 (`duckdb` Python CLI, no
// browser) — the `verified` field is the row/value DuckDB actually returned
// that day, not a guess. Re-run them yourself to check currency.
