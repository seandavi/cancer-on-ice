"""US Census ACS 5-year Summary File (detailed tables) -> Iceberg (SPEC.md
§ Sources: "ACS 5-year (curated table subset) -- demographics, insurance,
poverty, vehicle access | public domain; MOE -> interval_level = 0.90").

**Indicator-set decision (#29 was held on "which table subset?").** The subset
is the indicator set Cancer InFocus (CIF) publishes, since CIF parity is the
adoption path SPEC.md's Landscape section names ("an export recipe that writes
CIFTools-shaped files ... is a better adoption path than a rival dashboard"):
age (under 18, 18-64, 65+), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, NH White, NH Black, NH
Asian, other), educational attainment (no HS diploma; bachelor's+), median
household income, poverty, unemployment and labor-force participation,
vehicle access (no vehicle households), vacant housing, rent burden (>=30%
and >=50% of income), the Gini index, limited English, plus total population
as a universe. **Health insurance and Medicaid are NOT landed in this PR** --
see "Dropped: health insurance / Medicaid" below.

**Upstream, and why this module does not call the Census Data API.** The
issue's brief assumed "the Census Data API ... works without a key for low
volume." That is no longer true, verified 2026-09-18: every endpoint tried
(`https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5[/profile|/subject]?get=...`),
including a single-variable, single-state request, HTTP 302-redirects to
`https://api.census.gov/data/missing_key.html` with header
`X-DataWebAPI-KeyError: 1`. Only the *metadata* endpoints
(`/variables.json`, `/groups/<table>.json`) are still keyless -- used here at
authoring time to look up variable labels, never at ingest time. Per this
issue's instructions ("if a key is demanded, stop and report (never commit a
key)"), this module uses the brief's documented fallback instead: the ACS
**table-based Summary File**, a bulk, keyless, per-table download --

    https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/<year>/table-based-SF/data/5YRData/acsdt5y<year>-<table>.dat

-- one pipe-delimited `.dat` file per detailed table, nationwide (every
summary level in one file), verified 2026-09-18 by downloading the tables
below for the 2023 and 2021 releases. Because no Census Data API endpoint is
ever called, the API Terms of Service attribution sentence the issue asked to
quote does not currently apply; quoted here anyway for the record, and for
whoever adds a keyed API lander for the Data Profile/Subject tables later:
"This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not endorsed or
certified by the Census Bureau." (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about/terms-of-service.html).

**Why detailed (B/C) tables, not Data Profile (DP) or Subject (S) tables.**
CIF's own indicators map most directly onto DP02/DP03/DP04/DP05 (education,
income, poverty, employment, insurance, housing) and S0101/S2701/S2704 (age,
insurance) -- confirmed by inspecting their variable labels via the metadata
endpoints. But the table-based Summary File **only ships detailed tables**
(confirmed: its `5YRData/` directory lists ~1,193 `acsdt5y<year>-b*.dat` /
`-c*.dat` files and zero `dp*`/`s*` files) -- Data Profile and Subject tables
are a data.census.gov/API-only convenience layer computed from the detailed
tables, unreachable without a key. This module uses the closest detailed-table
equivalent of each CIF indicator instead (table -> concept, verified against
each table's real header and variable labels, 2026-09-18):

    B01003  Total population                          (universe)
    B09001  Population under 18 years by age           (age: under 18)
    B09020  Population 65 years and over ...            (age: 65 and over)
    B03002  Hispanic or Latino origin by race           (race/ethnicity)
    B15003  Educational attainment for the population
            25 years and over                          (no HS diploma; bachelor's+)
    B19013  Median household income in the past 12
            months                                      (median household income)
    C17002  Ratio of income to poverty level in the
            past 12 months                              (poverty)
    B23025  Employment status for the population
            16 years and over                           (labor force participation; unemployment)
    B25044  Tenure by vehicles available                (no vehicle households)
    B25002  Occupancy status                            (vacant housing)
    B25070  Gross rent as a percentage of household
            income (GRAPI)                              (rent burden >=30%, >=50%)
    C16002  Household language by household limited
            English speaking status                     (limited English)
    B19083  Gini Index of Income Inequality             (Gini index)

Age 18-64 is not published anywhere in ACS as a single variable (every age
table bins in 5- or 10-year spans that straddle 18); it is derived as the
residual `B01003_E001 - B09001_E001 - B09020_E001` (see "Margins of error"
below). Race/ethnicity "other" sums NH American Indian/Alaska Native + NH
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander + NH Some Other Race + NH Two-or-more.
Education's "no HS diploma" sums B15003's 15 sub-diploma categories (rows
002-016: no schooling through "12th grade, no diploma"); "bachelor's or
higher" sums bachelor's + master's + professional + doctorate (022-025).
Rent burden's denominator is `B25070_E001 - B25070_E011` (excluding "Not
computed"), matching DP04's own GRAPI universe definition.

**Dropped: health insurance / Medicaid.** CIF's insurance indicators
(uninsured; Medicaid) map cleanly onto Subject tables S2701/S2704 (a single
"Percent Uninsured" / "Percent Public Coverage, Medicaid row" variable each)
-- but those are API-only (see above). Their detailed-table equivalents
(B27001 "Health Insurance Coverage Status by Sex by Age", 230 variables;
B27010 "Types of Health Insurance Coverage by Age", 266 variables) are
230-266 columns each because ACS never publishes an un-stratified insurance
total as a detailed table -- landing either whole (this module's own
convention: land every variable of a requested table) is 250-580MB per
release for a single overall rate, table-based-SF bulk file size scaling
observed directly: 1 variable-pair (B19083) = ~10MB, 11 (B25070) = ~46MB, so
~4MB/variable-pair; not worth it for two numbers.
ponytail: revisit once an API key is available (S2701/S2704 directly), or if
a compact insurance-total detailed table turns out to exist that this survey
missed.

**Licence.** U.S. Census Bureau content is a federal government work. Per
resources.data.gov/open-licenses/: "Data and content created by government
employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to domestic
copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. Sec 105. Government works are by default
in the U.S. Public Domain." (checked 2026-09-18, same citation as
census_gazetteer.py and ers_rucc.py.)

**Version axis and geo_vintage.** `acs_year` is the 5-year release's END
year (e.g. 2023 for "the 2019-2023 release"); `source_release` downstream is
`f"{year-4}-{year}"`. Two releases are landed: **2023** (2019-2023, the
latest reachable) and **2021** (2017-2021) -- NOT 2018 (2014-2018): the
table-based Summary File format only exists from the "2021" vintage onward
(`https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/<year>/table-based-SF/`
404s for 2020 and earlier, 200 from 2021, checked 2026-09-18); 2014-2018 is
only published in the older sequence-based format (per-state fixed-layout
files joined against a sequence-to-variable crosswalk), a different enough
parser that supporting it is out of scope here. 2019-2023 and 2017-2021
overlap by three years -- the closest "non-overlapping-ish" pair this format
reaches, exactly as the issue brief anticipated might be necessary.
`geo_vintage` is verified directly against each release's own Connecticut
county rows, not assumed from a landed Gazetteer vintage (SPEC.md): the
2019-2023 file's county rows for state 09 are the nine 2022 planning regions
(09110-09190) -> `GEO_VINTAGE[2023] = 2020`; the 2017-2021 file's are the
eight legacy counties (09001-09015) -> `GEO_VINTAGE[2021] = 2010` -- the same
two vintage labels PLACES and the Gazetteer use for the pre/post-2022
Census county definitions.

**Geography scope: county and tract, filtered mechanically, not landed
whole.** The table-based Summary File interleaves every summary level (nation,
state, county, place, tract, block group, ...) in one national file per
table -- unlike census_gazetteer.py's or cdc_svi.py's upstream, which ship a
separate file per level. `land_raw` filters each downloaded file to the
`GEO_ID` prefix for the requested `--level` (`0500000US` = county,
`1400000US` = tract) before landing -- a mechanical geography-level split
applied uniformly to every column, not a curated row subset, and the same two
levels SPEC.md's Sources table declares for ACS.

**Margins of error.** Per U.S. Census Bureau, *Understanding and Using
American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know* (2020),
Chapter 8, "Calculating Measures of Error for Derived Estimates"
(https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_2020_ch08.pdf):
  - **Sums** (formula 1): MOE = sqrt(sum of each component's MOE squared).
    Chapter 8 also notes that a *difference* of two estimates uses the same
    formula as a sum "ignoring covariance" (the sum/difference formulas
    differ only in the sign of a covariance term this approximation already
    drops) -- so the age 18-64 residual and the rent-burden GRAPI-computable
    denominator (both differences) reuse the sum formula rather than a
    separate one.
  - **Proportions/percentages** (formula 6, numerator a subset of the
    denominator): `MOE(P) = (1/Y) * sqrt(MOE(X)^2 - P^2 * MOE(Y)^2)`, and "if
    the value under the square root is negative, ... substitute a 'plus' for
    the 'minus' sign" -- both implemented in `_pct` below.
All of this module's percentages (age, race/ethnicity, education, poverty,
labor force, vehicle, vacancy, rent burden, limited English) are nested
proportions in this sense; the Gini index and median household income are
landed as single cells with their own published MOE, no combination needed.

**Sentinels (ACS "jam values").** Per the Census Bureau's official
"Jam Value Specifications for the 2023 American Community Survey"
(https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/jam_values/2023_Jam_Values.xlsx,
downloaded and parsed 2026-09-18 -- the same values are also documented,
without the full table, at
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/acs/acs_table_based_summary_file_handbook_ch03.pdf):

    Estimate jam values (all present in the real 2023/2021 downloads):
      -666666666  "Estimate not computed due to insufficient number of
                   sample cases."                    -> suppressed_small_count
      -999999999  "Estimate not displayed due to insufficient number of
                   sample cases for selected geography."
                                                       -> suppressed_small_count
      -888888888  "Estimate not applicable or available."  -> not_applicable
    MOE jam values (all reachable via the same source; -222222222 and
    -333333333 confirmed present in the real B19013/B19083 downloads):
      -222222222  "MOE not computed due to insufficient number of sample
                   cases."                            -> value stays reported,
                                                          lower/upper = NULL
      -333333333  "MOE not computed for medians in lower or upper interval"
                   -- i.e. the estimate itself is an artificial open-interval
                   boundary, not a real median               -> not_available,
                                                          value = NULL too
      -555555555  "MOE not appropriate - estimate is controlled ... MOE may
                   be treated as zero"                -> value stays reported,
                                                          lower/upper = NULL
      (MOE also reuses -888888888 / -999999999 for "MOE not applicable" /
      "MOE not displayed" -- same NULL-the-interval-only treatment.)

Per this issue's instructions, an unmapped negative-jam-looking cell
(`-\\d{6,}` matching none of the six values above) raises `SystemExit` in
`land_raw` rather than landing silently -- see `_check_sentinels`.
`median_household_income` is the one measure with a real median (a $-value
that ACS artificially pins to $2,500 or $250,001 when the true median falls
in an unbounded bracket): it gets the extra `-333333333 -> not_available`
rule; every other measure treats a jammed MOE as "value reported, interval
unavailable" per the brief.

**Composed-measure suppression.** Measures built by summing or ratio-ing
several raw cells (race "other", education, poverty, vehicle access, rent
burden, limited English) collapse any contributing jam value to
`suppressed_small_count`, rather than distinguishing `not_applicable`
per-leaf.
ponytail: acceptable because at county granularity (this module's actual
real-ingest target) these tables show effectively zero suppression, and where
suppression does appear (small tracts) `-888888888`/"not applicable" on a
*population-count* table is rare -- the dominant real cause is small sample.
Revisit with a per-leaf cause if a future ingest surfaces meaningful
`not_applicable` volume among composed measures.
