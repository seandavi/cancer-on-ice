"""HRSA health-center sites + primary-care HPSA designations -> Iceberg.

Upstream: https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download lists both as CSV downloads.
Direct URLs (stable, verified 2026-09-18 via HTTP HEAD -- both respond
`Last-Modified` as of the same day, confirming they are refreshed in place
daily rather than published as dated editions):
  - Health Center Service Delivery and Look-Alike Sites (FQHC sites):
    https://data.hrsa.gov/DataDownload/DD_Files/Health_Center_Service_Delivery_and_LookAlike_Sites.csv
  - Primary-care HPSA designations (dental/mental-health siblings exist as
    BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_DH.csv / _MH.csv but are not landed here -- issue #38
    asks for primary care "at minimum"):
    https://data.hrsa.gov/DataDownload/DD_Files/BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_PC.csv

**Licence.** HRSA's own Data Usage Terms & Conditions, shown on the download
page for each dataset (https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download, checked
2026-09-18): "Health Center Service Delivery Sites (HCSD)" (Data Published
by: HRSA, Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC)) and "Health Professional
Shortage Areas (HPSA)" (Data Published by: HRSA, Bureau of Health Workforce
(BHW), Division of Policy and Shortage Designation (DPSD)) both state
"Usage limitations: None". HRSA is also a federal agency, so both are
independently a U.S. Government work: "Data and content created by
government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject
to domestic copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. Sec 105. Government works
are by default in the U.S. Public Domain." (https://resources.data.gov/
open-licenses/, checked 2026-09-18).

**No individual-provider records.** Every column of both files was read
2026-09-18: site/grantee/organization names and addresses only (e.g. "Site
Name", "Health Center Name", "HPSA Name", "HPSA Component Name"); no column
names or holds an individual clinician.

**Version axis: retrieval date.** Neither file publishes an edition label --
each is a live snapshot HRSA overwrites in place -- so `retrieved_on` (this
ingest's UTC date) is the version column raw is scoped and replaced by, and
`merge.manifest` is called with `method="retrieval_date"` (SPEC.md's
versioning model already reserves this for exactly this case).

**Header quirk, both files.** The real header line ends in a stray trailing
comma, producing a spurious empty final column name, while every data row
has one fewer field than the header (verified 2026-09-18 against the live
downloads and reproduced byte-for-byte in the fixtures). `COLUMNS`/
`HPSA_COLUMNS` hold the real columns only; `_check_header` tolerates exactly
that one trailing empty field (mirrors census_gazetteer.py's trailing-
whitespace quirk) and `null_padding=true` in the read_csv call pads it with
NULL rather than shifting every real column over.

**facility_id.** HRSA's "BPHC Assigned Number" (e.g. 'BPS-H80-000078') is
the per-site id: verified unique across all 19,246 rows of the live file
(2026-09-18). "Health Center Location Identification Number" looks similar
but is a lookup code (only 3 distinct values file-wide) -- not a site id.

**Geography.** SPEC.md's facility.site calls for a tract-level geo_id;
HRSA's health-center file publishes only county FIPS, so `geo_id` here is
'county:'+FIPS -- a documented gap, not a tract lookup this module performs.
`GEO_VINTAGE = 2020`: the live file's Connecticut rows carry only the nine
2022 planning regions (09110-09190, never the eight legacy counties
09001-09015) and its Alaska rows carry only current census areas (e.g.
02063 Chugach, 02066 Copper River, never the retired 02261 Valdez-Cordova),
both markers of 2020-vintage Census geography (2026-09-18).

**attributes_json, not a map.** SPEC.md's facility.site declared `attributes
map<string,string>`. A DuckDB MAP value cast through Arrow into that Iceberg
schema aborts the process outright -- Arrow's C++ validator fails a check
("Map array keys array should have no nulls") that is not a catchable
Python exception, confirmed with a minimal repro 2026-09-18 -- so
facility.site.attributes_json is a JSON string column instead (this PR
edits SPEC.md's facility.site declaration to match).

**HPSA: geographic designations only.** Only 'Geographic HPSA' and 'High
Needs Geographic HPSA' rows carry a usable county FIPS on every row;
'HPSA Population', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', its Look-Alike
sibling, 'Rural Health Clinic', 'Correctional Facility', 'Other Facility'
and the IHS/Tribal designation type are population-group or facility
designations that don't fit geo_id (SPEC.md's own note on issue #38) -- they
land in raw but are not derived. A HPSA with sub-county components (Census
Tract / County Subdivision) repeats one row per component, all sharing the
same county FIPS; `transform` deduplicates on (HPSA ID, FIPS) before
counting so a multi-component HPSA counts once per county, not once per row.

ponytail: only two measures are derived from HPSA -- a per-county count of
currently-designated ('HPSA Status' = 'Designated') primary-care geographic
HPSAs and their max HPSA Score -- rather than reconstructing HRSA's own
shortage-index math (SPEC.md non-goal: republish, don't compute). period is
the retrieval date, since HRSA HPSA designations are a live roster with no
published period of their own.

ponytail: a currently-Designated geographic HPSA with a masked/placeholder
FIPS ('XXXXX'/'XXX', seen only on Withdrawn / Proposed For Withdrawal rows
as of 2026-09-18) is silently excluded from the county aggregation rather
than raising -- that combination doesn't exist in the real file today, and
would be a HRSA data-quality anomaly if it appeared, not something this
ingest should hard-stop on.

**facility.site.source_release is NULL for HRSA_HC.** facility.site's
business key is (facility_id, source) -- source_release is deliberately
excluded from it (issue #19). An earlier version of this module set
source_release to the retrieval date, which -- since merge.merge diffs every
non-key column -- made every unchanged site open a fresh Type-2 version on
every single ingest: 19k rows of churn per run for zero real change. HRSA_HC
writes NULL there instead: the snapshot date is already recorded in
provenance.release and in raw.hrsa__health_center_sites.retrieved_on, so an
unchanged site now merges as 'unchanged' across retrieval dates the way
RUCC/PLACES rows do, and a site's *actual* content change still opens a new
version. This is an interim fix under issue #19, not a resolution of it --
see merge.py's and schemas.py's own notes on that.
