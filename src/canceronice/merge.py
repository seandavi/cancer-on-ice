"""Release-scoped merge maintaining full Type 2 history.

A row is one **version** of a record, valid over `[valid_from, valid_to)` in
cancerOnIce release coordinates. Merging the complete upstream state for a
scope sorts every record into one of five outcomes:

  new         business key absent      -> insert, valid_from = this release
  unchanged   present, attrs identical -> carried forward untouched
  changed     present, attrs differ    -> close the old row at this release
                                          and insert a new version
  retired     absent upstream          -> close the old row at this release
  history     already closed           -> untouched

Within the release being built, all of that is a draft: a row opened at this
release is replaced rather than superseded, one retired at this release that
comes back identical is reopened, and one opened and retired at this release
is dropped. Only earlier releases are history.

Nothing is ever updated in place. That is the point: overwriting a changed
attribute is Kimball Type 1, which destroys history, and it is what made a
point-in-time query return transcripts pointing at genes that did not yet
exist. Closing and reopening also collapses "changed" and "reappeared" into one
rule rather than two — see biocOnIce ADR-0006.

Which columns form the business key comes from the table's own declaration, so
this works for any table in `schemas.TABLES` without being told about it.

ponytail: column names are `valid_from`/`valid_to`, ported unchanged from
bioc-on-ice. SPEC.md's `first_seen`/`retired_in` naming and the versioning
semantics generally are deliberately unsettled for this repo — see the
tracking issue for renaming (or reconciling) once that's decided; don't
invent new versioning logic here in the meantime.

ponytail: recomputes the scope's complete state and overwrites the scope rather
than writing only changed rows. PyIceberg's `upsert` derives a filter predicate
from every join key and does not complete on five million rows. Storage is
unaffected once snapshots expire, because history lives in the rows. Upgrade
path if write time matters — first choice: DuckDB MERGE INTO pushed down
against the Iceberg REST catalog (duckdb-iceberg supports MERGE per the DuckDB
release notes), gated on two verifications: it must work through icegate
against R2 Data Catalog (beta; delete-file support unverified), and the
offline test substrate — the local sqlite PyIceberg catalog — cannot take
DuckDB writes, so the local path stays PyIceberg regardless. Second choice:
go insert-only and compute `valid_to` as a `LEAD()` window in a view, which
is where Data Vault has moved.
