"""US Census Bureau Gazetteer Files -> geography.unit, the non-geometry half
of the geography spine (SPEC.md § Geography).

Upstream: https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html
lists one national county file and one national tract file per vintage year,
zipped tab- (or, from 2025, pipe-) delimited text under
https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/, e.g.
`2024_Gazetteer/2024_Gaz_counties_national.zip`. The 2010 files live at the
same host without a year folder or prefix (`Gaz_counties_national.zip`) and
carry two extra 2010-Census columns, POP10/HU10, that later vintages drop.

**Licence.** U.S. Census Bureau content is a federal government work. Per
resources.data.gov/open-licenses/ (the definition data.gov uses for every
federal agency's "Public Domain" listing): "Data and content created by
government employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to
domestic copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. § 105. Government works are by
default in the U.S. Public Domain." No registration or attribution is
required to redistribute.

**Version axis: release.** Each file is one dated annual (or decennial)
edition, e.g. "2024_Gazetteer" — a citable label the source itself publishes,
not a retrieval date, so `merge.manifest` is called with
`method="release_number"` and `version=<the gazetteer year>` (SPEC.md's
vintage rule for sources with no other version label).

**Geography vintage.** The gazetteer year *is* the boundary vintage: Census's
own TIGER/Line documentation states legal boundaries and names in a given
year's shapefiles are "as of January 1" of that year (confirmed against the
2020, 2022 and 2023 TIGER/Line pages), and the gazetteer files are released
under the same year label as extracts of the matching TIGER/Line vintage — the
switch from Connecticut's eight counties (present through the 2020 files) to
its nine planning regions, FIPS 09110-09190 (present from at least 2024),
lines up with Connecticut's real-world 2022 change and confirms the two
follow the same clock.

**Header quirk.** The 2010 and "modern" (2011-2024) layouts pad their last
header column, INTPTLONG, with trailing spaces before the newline; the 2025+
layout does not, and also gained a fully-qualified `GEOIDFQ` column and
switched delimiter from tab to pipe. Three real layouts, two file kinds ->
`COUNTY_COLUMNS`/`TRACT_COLUMNS` hold one COLUMNS contract per layout instead
of a single module-level COLUMNS (the source-common convention assumes one
layout per source; this source has three, verified 2026-09-18 against the
real 2010, 2020 and 2026 files). A header matching none of them raises
SystemExit before anything is read, same as a single-layout source.

**Encoding quirk.** The 2010 county file has one stray Latin-1 byte instead of
UTF-8 (NM 35013, "Doña Ana County"); every other vintage checked, and the 2010
tract file (which has no NAME column to carry the accent), are clean UTF-8.
`_ensure_utf8` decodes the whole file as Latin-1 on a UTF-8 failure — safe
because the rest of the file is plain ASCII, where Latin-1 and UTF-8 agree —
recovering the intended character exactly rather than raising or replacing it
with U+FFFD.

ponytail: only counties and tracts are landed (SPEC.md M1 asks for county +
tract, 2010 + 2020 + latest). Places, county subdivisions, ZCTAs, PUMAs and
every other gazetteer file are not — add one alongside these two if a later
milestone needs it.

ponytail: state names come from `raw.census__state_fips`
(https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/state.txt, landed once per
release, not per vintage — FIPS-to-state assignments don't move on the
gazetteer's cadence). If that file can't be reached, `land_state_fips` warns
and returns 0 rather than failing the whole ingest; `transform` then falls
back to the state's USPS code as its name, and says so in the same way.

ponytail: layout choice is decided purely by matching the file's own header
against the three known contracts, not by branching on the year — so a year
outside 2010/2011-2024/2025+ that happens to match a known layout still lands
correctly, and one that doesn't fails loudly rather than guessing.

ponytail: no `geography.crosswalk` row for the Connecticut county -> planning
region transition. Each vintage's units stand on their own; a weighted
crosswalk (SPEC.md Acceptance B) is a separate, still-open piece of work.

---

**Districts (#104).** The same Gazetteer host also carries one national
congressional-district (CD) file and one national state-legislative file per
chamber (SLDU/SLDL upper/lower) per vintage year, e.g.
`2024_Gazetteer/2024_Gaz_119CDs_national.zip`,
`2024_Gazetteer/2024_Gaz_sldu_national.zip` — confirmed 2026-09-19 against the
2024 and 2026 gazetteer directory listings. Same public-domain licence as
above (same host, same federal-agency doctrine); checked again 2026-09-19.

**CD version axis: Congress number, not the gazetteer year.** The issue's own
framing states it: "Congress number / redistricting cycle = the boundary
vintage." Census re-labels the CD file for whichever Congress its maps
currently serve (2024_Gazetteer → 119CDs, 2026_Gazetteer → 120CDs, even before
the 120th is sworn in) and updates it mid-cycle for court-ordered redraws —
confirmed real: North Carolina's district 3701 carries a materially different
ALAND/AWATER between the 2024 (119CDs) and 2026 (120CDs) files, the same
boundary vintage window the issue names (NC, AL, LA, NY, GA). `land_districts`
resolves the Congress number for a gazetteer year from `CD_CONGRESS`
(verified against the real directory listings, 2017-2026) rather than
guessing a formula, and skips CD (warn, continue) for a year outside it — the
same graceful-degradation shape `land_state_fips`/`transform` already use for
state names, so a district-less year never fails the whole ingest.
`geography.unit.vintage` stays the gazetteer year for cd/sldu/sldl too (not
the Congress number) — consistent with every other level, and sufficient:
landing two gazetteer years both lands and keeps both boundaries queryable,
Congress number or not, exactly like Connecticut's county -> planning-region
switch above.

**GEOID, not a NAME column, for CD.** Unlike SLDU/SLDL (which publish NAME,
e.g. "State Senate District 1"), the CD file has no NAME column (like tracts)
— `transform` synthesizes "Congressional District N" from the GEOID's
district digits, "Congressional District At Large" for the single-district
states (WY, VT, ... — GEOID's last two digits '00', verified against the real
file).

**No 2010 layout for districts.** ponytail: CD/SLDU/SLDL are only landed in
the "modern" (2011-2024) and "2025+" layouts — the same two the 2024/2026
files above are in. The 2010-era files exist (`Gaz_cd111_national.zip`,
`Gaz_sldu_national.zip`, `Gaz_sldl_national.zip`, confirmed 2026-09-19) but
add a third naming scheme (`cd111`, the Congress number *before* "CDs") and a
third column layout (POP10/HU10, like 2010 counties) for a vintage this
milestone doesn't need — add `CD_COLUMNS["2010"]`/a `_cd_zip_url` 2010 case
alongside `COUNTY_COLUMNS["2010"]`'s if a later milestone lands district
history back to 2010.

**Block Assignment Files (BAF) — the block-to-district relationship, #104.**
Census's own answer to "which blocks (hence tracts) are in which district" is
not part of the Gazetteer: it is the redistricting BAF product, one zip per
state bundling several geography kinds, e.g.
`https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/baf2020/BlockAssign_ST01_AL.zip`
containing `BlockAssign_ST01_AL_CD.txt` (`BLOCKID|DISTRICT`, one row per 2020
Census block) among others — confirmed 2026-09-19 against the real Alabama
zip and against the Block Assignment Files reference page
(https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/block-assignment-files.html),
same public-domain licence. `land_baf` lands only the `_CD`/`_SLDU`/`_SLDL`
members into one raw table, `raw.census__baf`.

**BAF is a fixed 2020-cycle product, not an annual one.** The reference page
above carries only a "2020" tab — Census does not republish BAF for a
mid-decade CD redraw, so `baf_vintage` is the constant `"2020"`, not a year
(unlike the Gazetteer's `gazetteer_year`). A block's `district_code` in
`raw.census__baf` can therefore lag a state's most recent redraw; it is still
the only block-level detail Census publishes tying a block (hence a tract, by
its GEOID's leading 11 digits) to a district.

**geography.crosswalk (#25) does not exist yet.** `tract_district_weights` is
a *recipe* (SPEC.md § Recipes), not a landed table: it computes
`from_geo_id, to_geo_id, weight, weight_basis` from `raw.census__baf` on the
fly and returns it, rather than writing anywhere — #25 hasn't declared
`geography.crosswalk` for it to land in, and `weight_basis='block_count'`
(share of a tract's 2020 blocks assigned to a district) isn't one of
SPEC.md's declared bases (`population | housing_units | land_area`) since BAF
carries no population. Once #25 lands `geography.crosswalk` with a
`block_count` (or better, population-weighted once block population is also
landed) basis, this recipe's SELECT is what feeds it — see the PR for #104.
