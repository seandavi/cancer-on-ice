"""USDA ERS Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes -> Iceberg, tract level.

Upstream: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes
Sub-county rurality: primary and secondary RUCA codes at census-tract grain
(SPEC.md § Sources — first tranche: "rurality, food access"). Third writer in
the ERS family after RUCC (`ers_rucc.py`, #13) -- same publisher, same
licence basis, same Latin-1 caveat on the CSV edition.

**Licence.** Neither the product page, the documentation page nor the users'
guide (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes,
its `/documentation` and `/users-guide` pages, all checked 2026-09-18) states
a licence -- same as RUCC. USDA ERS is a federal agency; the RUCA
documentation page's own byline credits federal staff ("Elizabeth A. Dobis
or Austin Sanders", division RRED). "Data and content created by government
employees within the scope of their employment are not subject to domestic
copyright protection under 17 U.S.C. Sec 105. Government works are by default
in the U.S. Public Domain." (https://resources.data.gov/open-licenses/,
checked 2026-09-18).

**Version axis is the edition.** ERS publishes tract-level RUCA for 1990,
2000, 2010 (revised 2019) and 2020 (verified 2026-09-18 by fetching the
product page and listing every `/media/*.{csv,xlsx,xls}` link on it). Only
1990 and 2000 have no CSV/XLSX form -- `.xls` only, unreadable with DuckDB's
`excel` extension (`.xlsx`-only) and no new dependency is allowed, mirroring
`ers_rucc.py`'s 2013 omission.

ponytail: 1990/2000 not landed -- legacy `.xls` only, same reasoning as
`ers_rucc.py`'s 2013 omission. Revisit if ERS ever republishes either as CSV
or XLSX.

ponytail: the ZIP-code RUCA approximation (also on this product page) is OUT
OF SCOPE. It is keyed by ZIP code, and issue #64 has not yet settled what a
ZIP-keyed measure means in this lake (crosswalk to ZCTA? land ZIP as its own
geography level?) -- landing it here would prejudge that. Only the census
-tract files are landed.

**The two landed editions are genuinely different upstream layouts**, not
a header that merely drifted -- house rule "one COLUMNS layout per real
upstream layout, detected by header match" (AGENTS.md) applies literally:

- **2010** (revised 3 Jul 2019, per the workbook's own errata note) is an
  `.xlsx` with a 9-column `Data` sheet: `COLUMNS_2010`, read via DuckDB's
  `excel` extension (`INSTALL excel; LOAD excel;`). Row 1 of that sheet is
  the errata note, not data -- the real header is row 2 (`range='A2:...'`,
  `stop_at_empty=true` so the read stops at the sheet's actual last row
  rather than padding to Excel's 1,048,576-row ceiling). Reading it typed
  (not `all_varchar`) and then formatting numeric cells to VARCHAR ourselves
  avoids a DuckDB `excel`-extension quirk: `all_varchar=true` converts an
  Excel float to text at full double precision (`10.199999999999999` for a
  cell displaying `10.2`); casting a typed DOUBLE straight to VARCHAR does
  not have that problem (verified against the real file, 2026-09-18).
- **2020** is a plain CSV, `COLUMNS_2020`, encoded Latin-1 like RUCC's CSV
  (verified 2026-09-18: "Ca\xf1on City, CO" in `PrimaryDestinationName`)
  despite the server's `Content-Type` claiming
  UTF-8 -- decoding the header line as Latin-1 is safe regardless, since the
  header itself is plain ASCII.

Both editions land into the one `raw.ers__ruca_tract` table, discriminated by
`ruca_edition`; each edition's own columns are NULL on the other edition's
rows (`schemas.py`'s "a column exists here only once something populates it"
already anticipates exactly this: both editions are landed by this same PR's
end-to-end run, so every declared column is in fact populated by some row).

**Geography vintage.** `GEO_VINTAGE` maps each edition to the census-tract
boundary year it classifies (2010 tracts for the 2010 edition, 2020 tracts
for the 2020 edition) -- verified directly against each downloaded file, not
inferred from the edition label alone:

- **2010 edition**: Connecticut carries its eight *legacy* counties
  (09001-09015, e.g. "09001,CT,Fairfield County") and Alaska carries the
  pre-2019 "02261,AK,Valdez-Cordova Census Area" rather than its current
  Chugach (02063) / Copper River (02066) split -- both markers of 2010-vintage
  Census geography, confirmed in the downloaded workbook.
- **2020 edition**: this file carries TWO tract-FIPS columns, `TractFIPS20`
  (built on each tract's 2020-vintage county code: Connecticut's eight legacy
  counties, Alaska's post-2019 areas) and `TractFIPS23` (the same tracts
  under the county-equivalent codes ERS uses as of 2023 -- Connecticut's nine
  planning regions, 09110-09190). Both are genuinely present in the real file
  (verified 2026-09-18): e.g. tract 09001010101 (Fairfield County, legacy)
  appears as `TractFIPS20`, the same physical tract appearing as
  `TractFIPS23 = 09190010101` (Western Connecticut Planning Region); four
  zero-population Connecticut water tracts have `TractFIPS23 = 'N/A'`
  (no defined 2023 county assignment) while `TractFIPS20` is always
  populated. `geo_id` is derived from **`TractFIPS20`**, not `TractFIPS23`:
  it is always present, and it is what lines up with the 2020-vintage
  geography this cancerOnIce release already carries elsewhere
  (`census_gazetteer.py`'s vintage-2020 landing also uses Connecticut's
  legacy counties, "present through the 2020 files" per its own docstring)
  -- consistent by verification, not forced to match (AGENTS.md: "Do not
  force it to a landed Gazetteer vintage"). `TractFIPS23` and its
  `CountyFIPS23`/`CountyCode23`/`CountyName23` siblings still land in raw,
  verbatim, for whoever needs to join this file to a 2023-planning-region
  -keyed product (e.g. `ers_rucc.py`'s 2023 edition) later.

**Suppression.** Both editions use code `99` on both PrimaryRUCA and
SecondaryRUCA for the same thing: a zero-population tract with no
rural-urban identifier (`UrbanCoreType = 'Water'` on every `99` row checked)
-- `value_status = 'not_applicable'`, `value` NULL, never landed as the
number 99. No other sentinel (blank, `-999`, `*`) appears in either edition's
RUCA columns (checked directly, both files).

ponytail: `Population`/`LandArea`/`PopDensity` (2020) and the `_2010`
equivalents land in raw (they are part of the file) but are not derived into
`measure.observation` -- population denominators come from SEER/ACS
elsewhere in the lake, matching `ers_rucc.py`'s identical choice.
