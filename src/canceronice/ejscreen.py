"""EPA EJScreen (every archived edition, 2015-2024) -> Iceberg: land block group and
tract CSVs whole, derive the raw environmental indicators (not the demographic or
composite EJ/Supplemental indexes -- SPEC.md's "land raw, derive later if wanted").

**Upstream is gone; the archive is not.** EPA removed EJScreen from epa.gov in
February 2025 (SPEC.md's motivating "every release stays queryable" example -- #97).
`gaftp.epa.gov/EJScreen/` 404s (checked 2026-09-19). This module reads a DOI-bearing,
checksummed third-party archive instead: EDGI's "EPA Environmental Justice Screening
Tool (EJ Screen) data, 2015-2024" on Zenodo, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14767363
(https://zenodo.org/records/14767363), one zip per edition, deposited 2025-01-29.

**Licence.** The Zenodo deposit's own licence field is Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International (verified 2026-09-19 via `GET zenodo.org/api/records/14767363` ->
`"license": {"id": "cc-by-4.0"}`, and via the record page's "License:" field: "Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International") -- redistribution with attribution is
explicitly granted regardless of the underlying data's own status. That underlying
status independently permits reuse too: EPA's own disclaimers page states "Unless

(https://www.epa.gov/web-policies-and-procedures/epa-disclaimers, checked 2026-09-19)
-- EJScreen's block group/tract files are exactly such EPA-produced geospatial data.

**Version axis: the edition** (2015-2024), landed as `ejscreen_edition`. Geography
vintage is 2010 for 2015-2021, 2020 for 2022-2023, and 2022 for 2024 -- see
`GEO_VINTAGE`'s own comment for how that's verified; it is one edition finer-
grained than issue #97's own "2015-2021 -> 2010, 2022+ -> 2020" text.

**Members, verified 2026-09-19** by range-fetching each edition's real Zenodo zip's
central directory (the archive runs 1.1-5.9 GB per edition; only the needed member's
bytes are ever fetched -- see `_fetch_zip_member`) and decompressing each candidate
file's header. `MEMBERS` records the exact path inside each edition's zip. Two
editions (2023, 2024) ship several near-duplicate dated folders, some marked
"DoNotUse" -- `MEMBERS` points at one without that marker (2023: "2.22_September_
UseMe", not its "..._Patch_UseMe" sibling; 2024: "2.32_August_UseMe", the higher-
numbered of two "useMe"-marked drops).

**Tract exists for 2021-2024 only** (`TRACT_EDITIONS`) -- EPA's own separate tract
CSV, not an aggregation this module computes. 2015-2020 ship block group only.

**Column layout drifts every few editions**; EJScreen's own indicator names are
stable (`CONCEPT_COLUMN`) even though the surrounding ~130-380 percentile/breakdown/
demographic columns are not and are not worth hand-declaring a shifting union schema
for (unlike cdc_svi.py's two families, this source's editions don't cleanly bucket
into two). Instead: the handful of columns this module actually parses are declared
and verified per edition (`CONCEPT_COLUMN`, checked against the real header before
landing); everything else lands verbatim in `extra_json` (one JSON object per row,
the whole source row, text-valued) -- the same "declared columns for what's used, JSON
for the rest" shape SPEC.md's Facilities section already uses for
`facility.site.attributes_json` (a DuckDB MAP-to-Arrow crash forced that one; here it
is a 10-edition verification budget, not a crash, but the shape fits the same need).
No cell is dropped -- "land raw whole" still holds -- it is just not all individually
typed.

Verified indicator presence per edition, from real headers (module CONCEPT_COLUMN):
PM25/OZONE/DSLPM/PTRAF/PRE1960PCT/PNPL/PRMP/PTSDF/PWDIS are in every edition (2015
under different lowercase/dotted names: pm/o3/dpm/traffic.score/pctpre1960/
proximity.npl/proximity.rmp/proximity.tsdf/proximity.npdes). CANCER/RESP (NATA-based
air toxics cancer risk / respiratory hazard index) run 2015-2023, dropped in 2024 in
favour of RSEI_AIR (an RSEI-based air toxics score introduced in 2023, alongside
CANCER/RESP that one transition year). UST (underground storage tank proximity)
starts 2021. NO2 and DWATER (drinking-water non-compliance) start 2024 only.

**Suppression.** No numeric missing-value sentinel (SVI's -999, say) was found in any
sampled real row across editions -- EJScreen's convention is a blank field, which
DuckDB's `nullstr=''` already lands as NULL; `value_status` is `not_available`
wherever the concept column is NULL after `TRY_CAST`, `reported` otherwise.

**A definition, not just a column, can change under one name.** `ptraf` and `pwdis`
keep the same column name (PTRAF/PWDIS) across every edition but not the same
meaning -- their derived medians jump ~9,400x and ~34,000x respectively, exactly at
the 2024 edition (see `FAMILY_SPLIT_CONCEPTS`'s comment for the verification and
EPA's own confirmation of PTRAF's redefinition). Both are split into `pre2024`/
`2024` measure_ids so one id never spans incompatible definitions.

**Some territory tract ids are malformed in EPA's own file, not reconstructed
here.** 1,977 AS/GU/MP/VI rows (never PR) across the 2022-2024 tract editions carry
a geo_id shorter than the standard 11-digit tract GEOID -- e.g. American Samoa's
"6000100" where a real one looks like "01001020100" -- evidently zero-padded fields
that lost their padding somewhere in EPA's own pipeline before being concatenated,
by an amount that varies row to row. There is no reliable way to recover the true
11-digit id from the truncated one without an authoritative crosswalk this module
doesn't have, so (`transform`'s comment) these rows are excluded from
`measure.observation` rather than joined under a guessed id -- landed verbatim in
raw regardless, per "land raw whole".

**Not derived here** (ponytail, follow-up):
  - **Block group is landed (`raw.ejscreen__blockgroup`, every edition -- "the single
    widest environmental file" per the issue) but not derived into
    `measure.observation`.** `geography.unit.level` documents 'block_group' as a
    valid value but no source populates it yet (census_gazetteer.py lands county and
    tract only) -- the issue's own fallback ("land EJScreen's tract-level files
    first") is what this module takes. Revisit once a Gazetteer block-group source
    lands (or add one) -- geo_id there is not FK-enforced by Iceberg either way, so
    nothing here breaks; it would just start resolving.
  - **2015** is landed and its own five indicator-adjacent columns are mapped
    (`CONCEPT_COLUMN["2015"]`), same as every other edition -- no exclusion, unlike
    SVI's 2000/2010.
  - **The composite EJ Index / Supplemental Index** (which combine these exposure
    indicators with demographics) are not landed or derived -- the issue asks for the
    environmental indicators "raw value"; the indexes are a `derive later if wanted`
    per SPEC.md.
  - **Period**: `period_start = period_end = ejscreen_edition` -- these are annual
    modeled/monitored estimates (PM2.5, ozone, traffic, proximity counts), not a
    5-year ACS pooled window like SVI's ACS-derived concepts; no interval is
    published for any of them, so `interval_level`/`lower`/`upper` are always NULL.

# ptraf and pwdis are the same column name (PTRAF/PWDIS) in every edition

# ~9,400x -- and pwdis's from 0.0017 to 58.8 -- ~34,000x -- both exactly at the
# 2024 edition, the same boundary where cancer/resp/rsei_air and the CT geography
# already changed (module docstring). EPA's own public description of PTRAF
# confirms a real redefinition, not noise: version 2.3 (2024) computes it over
# roads within 10 km divided by distance in km, replacing the prior 500 m /
# distance-in-meters formula (https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-indicators,
# checked 2026-09-19) -- a ~1000x unit change alone, compounding with the wider
# radius. PWDIS shows the identical magnitude-and-boundary signature so is split
# the same way pending EPA's own documentation of its exact redefinition. Neither
# family is "wrong"; they are different measures that happen to share a column
# name, so they get different measure_ids rather than one id whose values are
# incomparable across editions (SPEC.md Acceptance A depends on that not
# happening). Every other concept's values move gradually release to release
