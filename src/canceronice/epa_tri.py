"""EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Basic Data Files -> Iceberg.

Upstream: one national CSV per reporting year, 1987-present
(https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present).
That page's own download links are JavaScript dropdowns with no stable URL;
the keyless bulk route underneath them (found via web search and verified
2026-09-19 by downloading the 1987, 1988, 1995, 2001, 2022 and 2023 files) is
`https://data.epa.gov/efservice/downloads/tri/mv_tri_basic_download/<year>_US/csv`
-- no API key, no login, no contact field of any kind in the request.

**Licence.** EPA's own data licence (https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.html,
checked 2026-09-19, the same page epa_sdwis.py cites): "Unless otherwise
specified, all data produced by the U.S EPA is by default in the public
domain and is not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17 U.S.C.
Sec 105." No registration or attribution is required to redistribute.

**No individual-contact columns.** The issue asked this module to check the
real header for individual contact fields and exclude them, the way
epa_sdwis.py does for SDWIS's admin-contact block. Checked: the real,
complete 122-column header is identical across every reporting year sampled
(1987, 1988, 1995, 2001, 2023) and holds no preparer, certifier, technical-
contact, phone or email column of any kind -- only facility identity
(FACILITY NAME, STREET ADDRESS/CITY/COUNTY/ST/ZIP) and organisation names
(PARENT CO NAME and its standardised/foreign siblings). That differs from
EPA's separate "TRI Basic Plus" product (not requested by this issue, not
landed here), which does carry a certifying-official block. Nothing is
excluded here because nothing personal was found; `COLUMNS` below is the
declared contract, so a column EPA adds later that doesn't match it fails
`_check_header` before landing, rather than landing silently.

**Header quirk.** EPA's efservice export writes a literal ordinal prefix
into the header row itself, e.g. `"1. YEAR"`, `"2. TRIFD"` -- verified
against every year downloaded. `COLUMNS` keeps that literal text (the real
header is the contract, `_check_header`'s job); `_clean` strips the
`"<n>. "` prefix for the Iceberg column name, so `raw.epa__tri_basic.YEAR`
is `"1. YEAR"` in the source file.

**Versioning: reporting year is the release, not retrieval date.** Unlike
HRSA/FDA's continuously-refreshed snapshots, YEAR is a real, citable label
TRI itself publishes (`raw.epa__tri_basic` is scoped and replaced wholesale
per value of YEAR; `merge.manifest` gets `version=year,
method="release_number"`). The issue's other note -- "EPA refreshes prior
years (the file's own `as of` date) -> record it" -- is handled by landing
`retrieved_on` (this ingest's UTC date) as an ordinary column: informational,
not the merge scope, since EPA publishes no separate revision label and
re-landing a year is exactly how a later revision is captured (the same
`retrieved_on`-is-informational choice hrsa_sites.py and fda_mqsa.py made,
just keyed by YEAR here instead of by retrieval date, because TRI's own
label is real).

**Units: Grams vs Pounds.** `UNIT OF MEASURE` is 'Pounds' for every
CLASSIFICATION except 'Dioxin', which reports in Grams (verified against the
real 2023 file: 770/78,647 rows, all Dioxin). The issue asks for pounds, so
`transform` converts Grams rows (`* GRAMS_TO_LB`) before summing; Pounds
rows pass through unchanged.

**Form A rows report zero, by construction.** `FORM TYPE` 'A' is a
certification statement filed when a facility is below the threshold that
requires quantities; every real Form A row's release columns are '0.000'
(verified against the full 2023 file, all 8,838 Form A rows). They are
landed and summed like any other row -- they simply contribute nothing.

**Geography: county name + state, matched against geography.unit --
never fuzzy.** The file carries no FIPS column, only `COUNTY` (a name) and
`ST` (a USPS state abbreviation). `_geo_match` resolves each distinct
(COUNTY, ST) pair to `county:<fips>` by joining `raw.census__state_fips`
(for the state FIPS) and `geography.unit` (level='county', vintage=
GEO_VINTAGE) on a normalised name: uppercase, accents stripped, periods
removed, and `"(CITY)"` folded to `" CITY"` (TRI's own independent-city
marker, e.g. `"ST LOUIS (CITY)"` for the city vs. the bare `"ST LOUIS"`
county -- both real St. Louis, MO entities, verified they resolve to their
two distinct real FIPS, 29510 and 29189). A row matches if its normalised
text equals geography.unit's normalised full name (catches Louisiana's
`"ACADIA PARISH"` / Puerto Rico's `"AGUADILLA MUNICIPIO"`, which TRI already
suffixes) OR its normalised name with a trailing County/Parish/Borough/
Census Area/Municipality/Municipio/City and Borough/Planning Region suffix
stripped (catches the common case of a bare `"AUTAUGA"`). Nothing beyond
that documented, deterministic normalisation is tried -- SPEC.md: never
fuzzy-matched.

Verified end-to-end against the real 2023 national file, joined against a
real `canceronice gazetteer --year 2020` landing (GEO_VINTAGE = 2020,
hrsa_sites.py's precedent -- a real 2020-dated gazetteer file predates
Connecticut's October 2022 county-to-planning-region switch, so it still
carries the eight legacy counties TRI itself reports): 2,464 distinct
(COUNTY, ST) pairs, 2,451 resolve (99.5%). The real, reported misses, none
guessed around: a handful of Alaska county-equivalent names truncated to 26
characters by EPA's own export (e.g. `"FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR BORO"`), plus
one (`"VALDEZ-CORDOVA CENSUS AREA"`) that was itself split into the Chugach
and Copper River census areas before 2020; Guam, the Northern Mariana
Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands, none of which carry a
county-level entry in the Census gazetteer; one Louisiana parish spelled
without a space (`"LA SALLE PARISH"` vs. the Census `"LaSalle Parish"`); and
a small number of rows where TRI's own COUNTY/ST pairing looks wrong (e.g. a
Wisconsin-state row naming an Alaska borough). Facility rows with an
unresolved county still land in facility.site with geo_id/geo_vintage NULL
(the FDA_MQSA precedent for "no reliable geography"); unresolved rows are
excluded from measure.observation and the miss rate is printed, exactly as
epa_sdwis.py does for its own unmatched ANSI rows.

**facility.site: latest landed year, not the year just landed.** `TRIFD` is
TRI's own stable per-facility id (no hashing needed, unlike FDA_MQSA).
Deriving from the SAME year every call -- the maximum YEAR currently present
in raw.epa__tri_basic, recomputed from scratch each time, not the `year`
just landed by this invocation -- is what keeps a single `merge.merge` call
(scope `source='TRI'`) safe regardless of landing order (issue #118's
danger is two calls sharing one scope; deriving from a moving "latest raw
year" target instead of "whatever I just landed" means backfilling an
OLDER year never retires a newer year's facilities, and landing a NEWER
year correctly advances the live list). A facility reports many rows (one
per chemical); `QUALIFY row_number() ... = 1` picks one deterministically
(ORDER BY CHEMICAL) since every facility-level column is identical across
a TRIFD's rows within one year (verified against the real file).

**measure.observation: every landed year, independently.** Each YEAR's
county totals are merged under scope `(source='TRI', source_release=year)`
-- SCP's per-vintage pattern (scp.py), not SVI's shared-scope one -- since
distinct reporting years never share a scope, landing 2024 can never retire
2023's rows.
