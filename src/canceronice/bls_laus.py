"""BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), county level -> Iceberg.

Upstream: https://www.bls.gov/lau/ describes the program; the flat files
themselves live at https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/ --
`la.data.64.County` (every county-equivalent series, tab-delimited,
fixed-width padded fields), plus the small lookups `la.series`, `la.area`,
`la.measure`, `la.footnote` (`la.period` is not landed separately -- its 13
rows are exactly 'M01'..'M13', already documented on raw.bls__laus_county.period).

**Access.** `download.bls.gov` and `www.bls.gov` both return HTTP 403
("Access Denied... bot activity that doesn't conform to BLS usage policy is
prohibited") to every request from this environment, with or without the
descriptive `USER_AGENT` below -- confirmed 2026-09-18 with curl, matching
BLS's own stated bot policy. Every real file used to build this module (the
five flat files above, and BLS's copyright page) was instead retrieved
byte-for-byte through web.archive.org's cached copies -- real BLS content,
just not fetched live. `_fetch` still tries the real `download.bls.gov` URLs
first (a maintainer running this outside whatever blocks this environment may
have no trouble), and only the fixtures/verification in this PR relied on the
archived copies. See the PR description for exactly which archived snapshots
and their timestamps.

**Licence.** BLS's own copyright page states: "The Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) is a Federal government agency and everything that we publish, both in
hard copy and electronically, is in the public domain, except for previously
copyrighted photographs and illustrations, ... You are free to use our public
domain material without specific permission, although we do ask that you cite
the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the source."
(https://www.bls.gov/opub/copyright-information.htm, confirmed byte-for-byte
via a 2020-10-16 web.archive.org snapshot since the live page 403s here; the
policy itself carries no expiry and BLS is also independently a U.S.
Government work under 17 U.S.C. Sec 105).

**Version axis: retrieval-date vintage, deduplicated by checksum.** BLS
revises prior months in place and the flat file always holds the complete
revised history -- there is no edition label to key on, only a moment of
retrieval (SPEC.md's versioning model already reserves `retrieved_on`-style
vintages for exactly this). SPEC.md's own vintage rule adds "several
retrievals with identical values are one vintage": `land_raw` hashes the
freshly-fetched county file (SHA-256) and compares it to the previous
`provenance.release` row's `checksum` for `source='bls_laus'` (merge.manifest
now accepts and records `checksum` -- this is its first real caller); an
identical hash lands nothing and reports "unchanged vintage" rather than
opening a new one for bytes that didn't change.

**Geography.** A series id is `'LAUCN' + <5-digit FIPS> + '00000000' +
<2-digit measure code>` (e.g. 'LAUCN010010000000003' = Autauga County, AL,
measure 03) -- verified directly against the real file: every one of its
3,225 areas carries the 'LAUCN' county prefix, so `transform` parses geo_id
straight out of `series_id` rather than joining `raw.bls__laus_series`.
`area_code` in `la.area` encodes the same FIPS as `'CN' + state(2) +
county(3) + '00000000'`.

`GEO_VINTAGE = 2020`, except Connecticut's nine planning regions (FIPS
09110-09190) get 2022 -- the same split census_gazetteer.py and cdc_svi.py
use, confirmed here from two real `la.area` snapshots: one from 2025-01-05
carries Connecticut's eight legacy counties (09001-09015) and zero planning
regions; one from 2026-01-03 carries the nine planning regions and zero
legacy counties. That flip matches the issue's "Connecticut planning regions
were adopted by LAUS in 2024" and lands on the same 2022 Census vintage the
other sources already use for the same real-world change (LAUS adopting the
recode two years after Census introduced it, same as PLACES/SVI's own lag
patterns) -- not a fresh vintage invented for this source.

**Louisiana / Katrina.** The real file confirms the expected 2005-2006 gap
directly: Orleans Parish (22071) reports normally through 2005-08, then
`footnote_codes='N'` with value '-' every month from 2005-09 through
2006-06, resuming with real values at 2006-07; the 2005 and 2006 annual
averages (period M13) are `'N'` too, since an average can't be struck over
mostly-missing months. Landed and derived like any other not_available run,
no special-casing needed.

**Kalawao County, HI (FIPS 15005).** Confirmed absent from `la.area`
entirely -- no area_code containing '15005' anywhere in the real file. BLS
LAUS simply never publishes a county-equivalent series for it (population
~90); this is not a suppressed value to map, so there is nothing to test with
a fixture row -- its absence from every table here is the correct outcome.

**Footnote codes**, enumerated from the real `la.footnote` (confirmed
2026-09-18 via web.archive.org; `FOOTNOTE_TEXT` quotes the file verbatim):

| code | meaning | value_status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N | Not available. | `not_available` (value NULL) |
| U | The annual average cannot be calculated due to missing monthly data. | `not_available` (value NULL) |
| P | Preliminary. | `reported` (reliability_flag='P') |
| A | Area boundaries do not reflect official OMB definitions. | `reported` (reliability_flag='A') |
| V | The survey was not conducted due to bad weather. Interpolated data were seasonally adjusted. | `reported` (reliability_flag='V') |
| W | The household survey was not conducted for this month due to bad weather. Data were interpolated. | `reported` (reliability_flag='W') |
| Y | Data reflect controlling to interpolated statewide totals because the survey was not conducted. | `reported` (reliability_flag='Y') |

N and U are the two footnotes actually confirmed against a literal '-' value
in the real file; U only ever appears on period='M13'. Y is confirmed with a
real reported value (Puerto Rico municipios, e.g. 2017-09 = 12.5). Any
footnote code not in this table raises `SystemExit` in `transform` rather
than being silently treated as either status.

ponytail: A, P, V and W are real, documented `la.footnote` codes but do not
occur anywhere in the specific vintage archived for this PR's fixtures/real
ingest (checked: the full real `la.data.64.County` download has only N, U and
Y). They are mapped anyway, straight from the real lookup file's text, but
untested against a live example -- P in particular is normally only ever
seen on the most recent month or two before BLS's next revision clears it,
so a slightly older captured vintage can easily show none.

**Derived**, `source='BLS_LAUS'`, not seasonally adjusted (every county-level
series in the real `la.series` carries `seasonal='U'` -- LAUS publishes no
seasonally-adjusted county series at all):
  - `BLS_LAUS:unemployment_rate` (measure 03, percent, universe "civilian
    labor force")
  - `BLS_LAUS:unemployed`, `BLS_LAUS:employed`, `BLS_LAUS:labor_force`
    (measures 04/05/06, persons)
`method='model_based'`: LAUS county estimates come from BLS's signal-plus-
noise time-series model benchmarked to state CPS controls, not a direct
survey tabulation below the state level.

ponytail: only the last 10 full calendar years plus the current year are
derived by default (`--since`, default `this_year - 10`) -- full history
(back to 1990 for most counties) stays in raw regardless, per this issue's
own scope; a later issue can widen the default or backfill the rest from raw
without re-landing anything.
