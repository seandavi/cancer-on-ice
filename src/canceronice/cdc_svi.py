"""CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) -> Iceberg.

Upstream: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/ -- county and tract CSVs for
US-wide editions 2000, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 (SPEC.md § Sources: "area-level
context index... land every published edition"). The download page
(svi-data-documentation-download.html) is a form; the underlying files were found by
reading its `js/loadXML.js` and live at
`https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/<edition>/csv/states_counties/SVI_<edition>_US_county.csv`
(county) and `.../csv/states/SVI_<edition>_US.csv` (tract), verified 2026-09-18 by
downloading all 14 real files.

CDC and ATSDR websites is not subject to copyright, is in the public domain, and may be

(https://www.cdc.gov/other/agencymaterials.html, checked 2026-09-18). SVI is produced by
ATSDR's Geospatial Research, Analysis & Services Program, a federal agency, in the course
of employees' official duties -- also a U.S. Government work under 17 U.S.C. § 105.

**Version axis: the edition** (2000, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022), landed as
`svi_edition`. "Methods and themes changed between editions, so an edition is a different
measure definition, not just a new period" (#40) -- verified directly: theme membership
(which raw variables feed RPL_THEME1-4) differs between the two landed layout families
(see below), so derived measure_ids embed the family, not just the edition.

**Editions landed: 2000, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 (county); same for tract (#92
lands 2000 and 2010's tract files too -- both are real, keyless bulk files at the same URL
pattern as the rest, verified 2026-09-19).**

**2000 and 2010 land into their own per-layout tables, not the shared raw.svi__county /
raw.svi__tract union (#92, following on from #40's deferral).** Neither fits safely into
the "2014"/"2020" layouts unioned below:
  - 2010's real header names a column "STATE" holding the 2-digit state FIPS code (e.g.
    '01'), while every 2014+ layout names its full state NAME column "STATE" (e.g.
    'Alabama') -- the same column name means a different kind of value depending on
    edition. Worse, 2000's OWN "STATE" column holds the full name (like 2014+, unlike
    2010) while its "ST" column holds the 2-digit FIPS (unlike 2014+, where ST is the USPS
    abbreviation) -- three editions, three different (ST, STATE) meanings, verified
    directly against all three real files. Landing any two of them under one shared
    column name would be a silent semantic trap for anyone querying raw directly, so 2000
    and 2010 each get a dedicated table (`raw.svi__county_2000`, `raw.svi__tract_2000`,
    `raw.svi__county_2010`, `raw.svi__tract_2010`) with their own real column names,
    matching the issue's suggested resolution.
  - 2010 has no E_/M_ ACS estimates or MOEs at all for several concepts this issue derives
    (structural Census 2010 SF1 100%-count only, no sampling error: AGE65, AGE17,
    SNGPRNT, MINORITY, GROUPQ have no M_ column in 2010 -- confirmed against the real file
    and against SVI-2010-Documentation-H.pdf's own "Based on 100% counts - no sampling
    error" notes). 2010 also has no disability variable at all -- the Census Bureau
    collected no tract-level disability data for either the 2010 Census or the 2006-2010
    ACS (same PDF), so 2010's theme 2 is Household Composition only (age 65+, age 17-,
    single-parent), one fewer component than every other edition's Household
    Composition/Disability theme.
  - **The 2000 county/tract CSVs ship with two header lines**, verified by downloading the
    real files: line 1 (`STATE_FIPS,CNTY_FIPS,...,G1V1R,...,USG1V1P,...`) does not match
    the data that follows it at all (its columns don't correspond to the values in any
    row); line 2 (`ST,COU,STCNTY,...,P_POV,...,RPL_THEME1,...,F_POV,...`) does -- e.g.
    Autauga County, AL's row 3 gives P_POV=0.1092, a plausible real 2000 poverty rate,
    lining up with line 2's column names, not line 1's. Line 1 appears to be a stale,
    vestigial header CDC never removed (its columns match the SVI 2000 Data Dictionary
    in SVI2000Documentation-H.pdf almost exactly -- an older naming CDC superseded without
    updating the file). `land_raw` skips line 1 (`HEADER_SKIP`) and verifies the real
    line 2 against the declared layout. 2000 has no E_/M_ raw ACS variables at all
    (understandable -- SVI 2000 draws on Census 2000, not a 5-year survey), so no MOE is
    ever published, matching 2010's MOE-less structural concepts in spirit but for every
    variable.

**Real documentation, fetched and read directly 2026-09-19** (neither is linked from the
current download page, but both are still live at their historical `map25` URLs, found via
a general web search rather than the page's own links):
`https://svi.cdc.gov/map25/data/docs/SVI-2010-Documentation-H.pdf` ("SVI 2010
Documentation - 3/31/2015") and
`https://svi.cdc.gov/map25/data/docs/SVI2000Documentation-H.pdf` ("About the Data /
Social Vulnerability Index 2000"). Also fetched: the CDC/ATSDR-published
`Comparison-of-Source-Data-and-Variables.csv`
(https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/Comparison-of-Source-Data-and-Variables.csv),
which tabulates data source (Census vs. ACS) and theme membership per variable per
edition and confirms every composition claim below.

**Three real column contracts (`LAYOUT`/`COUNTY_COLUMNS`), two methodology families
(`FAMILY`).** A layout is what header a real file has; a family is which measure_ids and
theme composition an edition asserts (module code keeps these separate on purpose --
collapsing them loses the fact that 2016/2018 share 2014's methodology but not its exact
header):
  - layout `"2014"` -- county 2014 only (127 columns, includes AFFGEOID and the trailing
    Shape/Shape.STArea()/Shape.STLength(), excluded from the union below).
  - layout `"2016"` -- county 2016, 2018 (verified byte-identical to each other; 2014's
    127 columns minus those same 4).
  - layout `"2020"` -- county 2020, 2022, and **tract 2022** (verified: the 2022 tract
    file's header is byte-identical to the 2020/2022 county header -- same layout,
    different geography grain -- so tract lands via the same code path with no new
    layout to declare; this is why tract landing extends past 2022 trivially but isn't
    wired up for other editions here).
  - family `"2014"` -- editions 2014, 2016, 2018 (layouts "2014" and "2016": identical
    concept columns and theme composition, verified from each real header's column
    order, despite the "2014"-only geometry/AFFGEOID columns).
  - family `"2020"` -- editions 2020, 2022 (layout "2020").
`raw.svi__county` unions all three layouts' columns (the "2020" layout plus the 13
columns unique to "2014": AFFGEOID and the POV/PCI group, since 2020 renamed poverty to
POV150 and dropped PCI from the methodology -- ArcGIS geometry columns excluded, per
SPEC.md's geometry non-goal); `raw.svi__tract` is exactly the "2020" layout.

Two more layouts, `"2000"` and `"2010"`, land into their own dedicated tables instead
(module docstring above) and so double as their own families -- `FAMILY["2000"] ==
"2000"`, `FAMILY["2010"] == "2010"`, each edition its own family, matching #92's
instruction that theme composition differs again from both the 2014 and 2020 families.

**Geography vintage is the edition's own year, not a landed Gazetteer vintage.** Each
edition's own data dictionary states its `AREA_SQMI` column is computed from "Census
Cartographic Boundary File - U.S. Tracts `<edition>` 500K" (SVI2014Documentation,
SVI2016Documentation, SVI2018Documentation, SVI2020Documentation, SVI2022Documentation,
all checked 2026-09-18) -- i.e. SVI documents each edition against its own year's Census
geography, not against the nearest 2010/2020 decennial vintage. Collapsing that into two
buckets is wrong at the edges, confirmed empirically against the real files:
  - **Alaska**: pre-2019 Valdez-Cordova (02261) appears through the 2018 edition; the
    2019 split into Chugach (02063) and Copper River (02066) appears starting with the
    **2020** edition (county count rises 3,142 -> 3,143, +1 net) -- this alone rules out
    treating 2020 as 2010-vintage, since a 2010-vintage file cannot contain a 2019 split.
  - **South Dakota**: the 2015 Shannon -> Oglala Lakota recode (46113 -> 46102) appears
    starting with the **2016** edition; 2014 still carries 46113.
  - **Connecticut**: the legacy 8 counties (09001-09015) persist through the **2020**
    edition; the 9 planning regions (09110-09190) appear starting with **2022** (county
    count rises 3,143 -> 3,144, net +1) -- same pattern as places.py and
    census_gazetteer.py, just landing at a different edition.
  These three changes account for the entire county-count sequence (3,142, 3,142, 3,142,
  3,143, 3,144) and each shows up at a distinct edition, confirming the vintage moves
  edition-by-edition rather than in two 2010/2020 steps. `GEO_VINTAGE` is therefore each
  edition's own year -- `{2014: 2014, 2016: 2016, 2018: 2018, 2020: 2020, 2022: 2022}` --
  for both county and tract (tract 2022 confirmed on the same file: STCNTY carries the
  planning regions there too). `GEO_VINTAGE["2000"] = 2000` and `GEO_VINTAGE["2010"] =
  2010` follow the same rule (each edition its own year) -- **2000 is not one of
  `geography.unit`'s landed vintages (2010/14/16/18/20/22/26)**, so a 2000 SVI row's
  `geo_id`/`geo_vintage` currently has no matching row to join against there. This module
  does not join to geography.unit for any edition (`geo_id`/`geo_vintage` are recorded as
  asserted by the source, per SPEC.md's model, not FK-checked at ingest time), so nothing
  here is *broken* by 2000's absence -- but it is worth flagging rather than silently
  forcing 2000 onto the nearest landed vintage (2010), which would misrepresent which
  boundaries its FIPS codes actually describe.

**Period**: the ACS 5-year window each edition's own documentation states under "Methods
> Variables Used" (svi.cdc.gov/map25/data/docs/SVI<edition>Documentation*.pdf, checked
2026-09-18): 2014 -> "2010-2014 (5-year)"; 2016 -> "2012-2016"; 2018 -> "2014-2018";
2020 -> "2016-2020"; 2022 -> "2018-2022". 2010 -> "2006-2010", per
SVI-2010-Documentation-H.pdf's "Methods > Variables Used": "American Community Survey
(ACS), 2006-2010 (5-year) data" for the ACS-sourced variables. 2000 -> "2000" (a single
year, not a 5-year window): SVI 2000 draws on Census 2000 directly, no ACS involved at
all (SVI2000Documentation-H.pdf). `PERIOD_OVERRIDE` corrects two of 2010's concepts away
from that family default: `age_65_plus` and `minority` are 2010 Census SF1 100%-count
variables in the 2010 edition specifically (unlike every other landed edition, where
both are ACS 5-year estimates), so their true period is the single year 2010, not
2006-2010 -- stated explicitly in the same PDF ("Based on 100% counts - no sampling
error"; "AGE65 ... 2010 SF1"). The RPL_THEME/RPL_THEMES percentile rows for the 2010
family keep the family's ACS window (2006-2010) since the published index itself blends
both sources into one score without attributing a period to the blend.

**Suppression.** -999 is SVI's numeric missing sentinel, published in both raw estimate
(E_/M_) and percent/percentile (EP_/MP_/EPL_/RPL_/SPL_) columns, confirmed present in
every landed edition's real file -> `not_available`, never a number (SPEC.md Acceptance
C). A margin of error can be -999 while its paired estimate is valid (or vice versa) --
each is checked independently; a suppressed EP_ value never derives a lower/upper from a
present MP_, and a present EP_ with a suppressed MP_ still derives `value` with no
interval.

**Derived**: `RPL_THEMES`/`RPL_THEME1-4` (rate_basis='index', method='derived') as
`measure_id = 'SVI:RPL_THEMES:<family>'` / `'SVI:RPL_THEME<n>:<family>'`, family '2000',
'2010', '2014' or '2020' (`FAMILY[edition]`) since theme composition genuinely differs
between all four (see `THEME_DESC`) -- plus the simple E_/EP_/P_ component variables
named in #40: poverty (100% threshold through 2018 (and 2000, 2010) as `SVI:poverty`,
150% threshold from 2020 as `SVI:poverty150` -- CDC's own renamed variable, confirmed
EP_POV -> EP_POV150 in the real files), no HS diploma, no vehicle, age 65+, minority,
limited English -- all five of the latter keep one stable measure_id across all four
families (verified: identical concept meaning in every layout, per
Comparison-of-Source-Data-and-Variables.csv). `SVI:uninsured` is not asserted by the
2000 or 2010 families at all -- neither publishes an uninsured variable (confirmed absent
from both real headers and from the comparison CSV). `interval_level=0.90` (ACS MOE)
where both a percent estimate and its MOE column are present and unsuppressed; 2000
publishes no MOE for anything, and 2010 publishes none for `age_65_plus`/`minority`
(100%-count, module docstring above), so those rows always land with `interval_level`
NULL, `lower`/`upper` NULL, and just a bare `value`.

ponytail: `age_65_plus` and `minority` are true 100%-count Census variables (no sampling
error) in the 2000 and 2010 editions specifically, versus ACS 5-year sample estimates
(`method='survey_direct'`) in every other landed edition -- `measure.definition.method`
still reads `'survey_direct'` for both regardless of which edition wrote it last, since
splitting these two concepts into their own family-suffixed measure_ids just to carry a
more precise `method` felt like more machinery than the nuance is worth (a 100%-count
value is if anything *more* certain than a sampled one, so nothing here overstates
precision the way a wrong period or a suppressed value read as zero would). Upgrade path
if a consumer needs a single method value per source_release: mint `SVI:age_65_plus:2000`/
`:2010` and `SVI:minority:2000`/`:2010` alongside the stable ids.

`measure.definition`/`measure.stratum` writes are scoped to the measure_ids this edition's
family actually asserts (`In("measure_id", ids)`), never wholesale per source -- SPEC.md's
"never replace wholesale per source" rule (issue #76): ingesting the 2020-family after the
2014-family must not delete the 2014-family's own theme definitions, since a 2014
`measure.observation` row's FK still points at them.

ponytail: `PCI` (per capita income, all editions through 2018 including 2000/2010) and
the structural variables this issue doesn't ask for (age17, disability, single-parent,
group quarters, housing type, crowding, race breakdowns added 2020, no-internet) land in
raw but are not derived -- "simple and cancer-relevant" per #40 names the six concepts
above; add more alongside `CONCEPT_COLUMN`/`CONCEPT_LABEL` if a later measure needs them.
