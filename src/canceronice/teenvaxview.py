"""CDC TeenVaxView / NIS-Teen HPV vaccination coverage -> Iceberg (#105).

Upstream: data.cdc.gov "Vaccination Coverage among Adolescents (13-17 Years)",
dataset id `ee48-w5t6` (found via web search against data.cdc.gov, confirmed by
downloading the live file, 2026-09-19):
https://data.cdc.gov/Teen-Vaccinations/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Adolescents-13-17-Years/ee48-w5t6.
It is ONE continuously-refreshed Socrata dataset covering every vaccine and
survey year (2006-2025 seen live) -- unlike places.py/cdc_svi.py, there is no
per-year dataset id to pick from.

**Licence.** This dataset's own Socrata metadata carries no `license` field
(checked directly against https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ee48-w5t6.json,
2026-09-19: both `license` and `licenseId` are absent) -- the same gap
fda_mqsa.py hit for FDA's list. CDC's site-wide content-usage page states:
"Most of the information on the CDC and ATSDR websites is not subject to
copyright, is in the public domain, and may be freely used or reproduced
without obtaining copyright permission," with "Attribution to the agency
that developed the material must be provided in your use of the materials.
Such attribution should clearly state the materials were developed by CDC
ATSDR and/or HHS" (https://www.cdc.gov/other/agencymaterials.html, checked
2026-09-19) -- the same basis cdc_svi.py uses, plus this being a U.S.
Government work under 17 U.S.C. Sec 105 (NCIRD employees' official duties).
Attribution per the dataset's own Socrata `attribution` field: "National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)".

**Version axis: retrieval-date vintage, deduplicated by checksum.** The
issue's own instruction ("appended yearly and occasionally revised -> vintage
by retrieval, survey year as the period") is exactly bls_laus.py's pattern:
`land_raw` hashes the downloaded bytes and compares against the most recent
`provenance.release` checksum for `source='teenvaxview'`; an identical hash
lands nothing (SPEC.md's vintage rule: "several scrapes that captured
identical values are one vintage").

**Header, verified against the live file 2026-09-19:** `Vaccine/Sample,Dose,
Geography Type,Geography,Survey Year,Dimension Type,Dimension,Estimate (%),
95% CI (%),Sample Size`. Landed under the same field names data.cdc.gov's own
SODA API uses (https://data.cdc.gov/resource/ee48-w5t6.json's fieldNames) --
`vaccine`/`dose`/`geography_type`/`geography`/`year_season`/`dimension_type`/
`dimension`/`coverage_estimate`/`ci_95`/`sample_size` -- rather than inventing
new names for columns the source already names sensibly.

**Scope: only vaccine='HPV' is derived, per the issue title and body** ("CDC
TeenVaxView / NIS-Teen HPV vaccination coverage"; the issue's SCP cross-
reference is HPV-specific too). Raw lands the WHOLE file, all 7 vaccines
(HPV, MenACWY, Tdap/Td, MMR, HepA, HepB, Varicella) verbatim (ADR-0002) --
`land_raw` does not filter by vaccine. `transform` filters to HPV.

**Dose: only >=1 Dose and Up-to-Date are derived, per the issue body**
("by vaccine/dose (HPV >=1 dose, up-to-date)"). HPV's other three published
dose families -- >=2 Doses, >=3 Doses, and "Series Completion (3 Dose) Among
HPV Vaccination Initiators" (verified against the live file: exactly these 5
dose families exist for vaccine='HPV') -- land in raw but are not derived,
the same choice cdc_svi.py makes for PCI and the structural variables #40
doesn't ask for. `DOSE_TYPE` maps the two derived families; an HPV dose
family not in `DOSE_TYPE` or `DOSE_TYPE_NOT_DERIVED` raises `SystemExit`
rather than silently landing nothing (a real upstream addition should be
noticed, not skipped quietly).

**Sex rides in the `Dose` cell, not a `Dimension`.** The live file has no
`dimension_type='Sex'` at all -- every dose string ends ", Males" / ", Females"
/ ", Males and Females" (verified: HPV's six >=1-Dose/Up-to-Date rows split
cleanly on the LAST ", "). `dose_type_text`/`sex_text` are that split;
`SEX_CODE` is the closed map (validated the same way as `DOSE_TYPE`) used to
build a compact `stratum_id`.

**Six real `Dimension Type` values, verified against the live file:**
'Overall' (one row, no breakdown), 'Age' ('13-15 Years' | '13-17 Years' --
published for every dose/sex, unlike the other four), 'Race and Ethnicity',
'Insurance Coverage', 'Poverty', 'Urbanicity' -- each published only for the
pooled-sex dose ("...Males and Females") except Age. `DIMENSION_TYPE` is the
closed map (short key -> `measure.stratum` field -> scheme suffix); an
unrecognised `Dimension Type` raises `SystemExit`. Insurance/Poverty/
Urbanicity all land in `measure.stratum.other` (no dedicated column for any
of the three) -- prefixed with the dimension type name (e.g. "Insurance
Coverage: Uninsured") so the three don't collide in one free-text field.
Source-native throughout (SPEC.md): the source's own category text is kept,
never recoded into a cross-source scheme.

**Period.** `Survey Year` is a single year ("2022") for almost every row, and
one pooled window ("2018-2022", verified: used for HPV's Insurance/Poverty/
Urbanicity/Overall breakdowns) for the rest -- split generically on '-'
(`period_start`/`period_end`) rather than hardcoding which years pool, so a
future pooled window needs no code change here.

**Suppression.** `Estimate (%)` is the literal sentinel `NA` when withheld (no
separate footnote column, unlike places.py/cdc_svi.py) -- verified: every NA
row also has blank `95% CI (%)`/`Sample Size`. CDC's own technical notes name
the reason: "If the unweighted sample size for the numerator was less than 30
or the [(CI half-width)/Estimate] was greater than 0.6, the estimate may not
be reliable or precise" (https://www.cdc.gov/teenvaxview/publications/
technical-notes-nis-teen-vaccination-coverage.html, checked 2026-09-19) -- a
reliability/precision threshold, not a privacy-driven small-count rule like
PLACES', so `value_status = 'suppressed_reliability'` (SPEC.md's enum), never
'suppressed_small_count'.

ponytail: `Sample Size` is NIS-Teen's own unweighted survey respondent count
underlying a *survey-weighted* percent estimate -- not a numerator/denominator
pair for `value` (same reasoning as PLACES' TotalPopulation, places.py's
module docstring). It lands in raw and stays there; `numerator`/`denominator`
are NULL in measure.observation.

**Geography.** Per the issue: "state and the NIS local areas (some are
cities/counties -- map the ones that are counties; leave the rest at their
published names in raw; report what did not map)." The live file's
`Geography Type='States/Local Areas'` carries 68 distinct values: 50 states +
DC + Puerto Rico + Guam + U.S. Virgin Islands (54, all mapped via the closed
`STATE_FIPS`) plus 14 named local areas. Of those 14, exactly seven are a
real single county and map via `LOCAL_COUNTY_FIPS`: TX-Bexar/Dallas/El Paso/
Hidalgo/Tarrant/Travis County, and PA-Philadelphia (the City of Philadelphia
is coextensive with Philadelphia County, FIPS 42101 -- confirmed against the
Census county list). The other seven -- IL-City of Chicago (overlaps but is
not coextensive with Cook County), NY-City of New York (five boroughs = five
counties), TX-City of Houston (spans Harris/Fort Bend/Montgomery), and the
four "...-Rest of state" residuals -- are not one county and stay unmapped
(`geo_id` NULL; excluded from measure.observation, left in raw only, same
technique as any other row `transform` can't place). `Geography
Type='HHS Regions/National'` carries 'United States' (-> `nation:US`) plus
ten `Region N` rows, which have no geo_id in the current spine and are left
unmapped too -- the issue's geography instruction names only "state and the
NIS local areas", not HHS regions. `transform` prints every distinct
unmapped `Geography` value it saw, per the issue's "report what did not map".

**geo_vintage is the constant 2020** (not tracked per row): none of the
mapped geographies (54 states/DC/territories at the state level, seven
counties) fall inside a FIPS range that changed vintage in this window --
Connecticut, the one state whose county FIPS moved (2022 planning regions,
places.py/cdc_svi.py's GEO_VINTAGE), only ever appears here as the whole
state (FIPS 09, unaffected), never as a TeenVaxView local area.

**Relation to State Cancer Profiles' own HPV measure (#27, per the issue).**
SCP's risk topic `vaccine` (`risk='v282'`, "Percent with Up-to-Date HPV
Vaccination Coverage") is drawn from this SAME NIS-Teen survey, at the state
level -- but `raw.scp__risk` is landed to raw only, not yet derived into
measure.observation (scp.py's module docstring: its geography/race vocabulary
need their own investigation first). `NIS_TEEN:HPV:uptodate` here is
therefore the first *live* up-to-date HPV vaccination measure in
measure.observation; once SCP's risk topic is derived, the two states-level
series should closely agree (same survey, same "up-to-date" definition) and
diverge only in vintage/rounding -- see each definition's `doc`.
