"""EPA SDWIS Federal (drinking-water violations) -> Iceberg.

Upstream: EPA ECHO's SDWA bulk download
(https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads -> "Safe Drinking Water Act
(SDWA)"), a single zip refreshed quarterly:
`https://echo.epa.gov/files/echodownloads/SDWA_latest_downloads.zip`
(verified 2026-09-18: HTTP header `content-length: 423774232`,
`last-modified: Thu, 09 Jul 2026`). Column definitions are documented at
https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/sdwa-download-summary ("SDWA Data
Download Summary and Data Element Dictionary"), which also states the files
are "refreshed quarterly." **The real downloaded header is the contract
checked here, not that page's own listing** -- the page's column list
differs slightly from the actual 2026Q2 file for two of the four files
(missing COMPL_PER_BEGIN_DATE/COMPL_PER_END_DATE/PWS_DEACTIVATION_DATE in
the violations file; page order and real order both verified by downloading
the real 424 MB zip, not by trusting the page).

Chosen over Envirofacts' `efservice` REST tables (the paged alternative
SPEC.md's issue #53 raised): the ECHO zip is one dated, complete extract:
`SUBMISSIONYEARQUARTER = '2026Q2'` on every row of every file in the real
download, a real citable version label the source itself publishes. Paging
`efservice` over 15M+ violation rows has no documented per-call limit *and*
a 15-minute request timeout, so a completeness guarantee would have to be
built by hand; the bulk zip already is one.

**Licence.** Public domain. The SDWIS dataset's own catalog.data.gov record
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/safe-drinking-water-information-system-sdwis,
checked 2026-09-18) names its License as
https://edg.epa.gov/EPA_Data_License.html, which states verbatim: "Unless
otherwise specified, all data produced by the U.S EPA is by default in the
public domain and is not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17
U.S.C. § 105." No registration or attribution is required to redistribute.

**Version axis.** `SUBMISSIONYEARQUARTER` ('2026Q2' in the checked download)
is a column in every one of the four files, not a per-source constant this
module invents -- unlike RUCC or the Gazetteer, whose editions live only in
the file name/URL. It is used directly as the raw overwrite-scope column
(no redundant edition column added) and as `source_release`/`merge.manifest`'s
`version` (`method="release_number"`).

**The four files landed.** `SDWA_PUB_WATER_SYSTEMS.csv`,
`SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv` and `SDWA_GEOGRAPHIC_AREAS.csv` are the
three the issue named. A fourth, `SDWA_REF_ANSI_AREAS.csv`, is landed too
(`raw.sdwis__ref_ansi_areas`) -- it is EPA's own small (~86 KB, ~3,000-row)
ANSI/FIPS county reference table, bundled in the very same zip, and it is
what makes `ANSI_ENTITY_CODE` (a real FIPS/ANSI code column, per SPEC's
preference over name-matching) resolvable to a full county FIPS: see
"Geography" below for why it is necessary rather than a hardcoded lookup.
`SDWA_EVENTS_MILESTONES.csv`, `SDWA_FACILITIES.csv`, `SDWA_LCR_SAMPLES.csv`,
`SDWA_PN_VIOLATION_ASSOC.csv`, `SDWA_REF_CODE_VALUES.csv`,
`SDWA_SERVICE_AREAS.csv` and `SDWA_SITE_VISITS.csv` are also in the zip and
are NOT landed -- out of scope for this issue's violations-by-county ask.

**Individual-contact columns excluded.** `SDWA_PUB_WATER_SYSTEMS.csv`'s real
header carries `ADMIN_NAME`, `EMAIL_ADDR`, `PHONE_NUMBER`,
`PHONE_EXT_NUMBER`, `FAX_NUMBER` and `ALT_PHONE_NUMBER` -- verified against
the real download to hold individual people's names, emails and phone
numbers (e.g. `ADMIN_NAME` "KLINGMAN, KEN" with a personal-looking email;
many small systems' admin contact is a named individual). All six are
excluded from `raw.sdwis__pub_water_systems` (SPEC.md/AGENTS.md: public
aggregates and organisations only, never individuals). `ORG_NAME` is kept:
it is documented as the system's legal-entity/organisation field, not a
contact field, even though for small sole-proprietor systems the legal
entity's registered name happens to be a person's name (the same public
business-registration fact any facility list in this lake would carry, not
an act of extracting personal data from a private list).

**Geography: PWSIDs are not counties, and this module counts violations
against counties served.** `SDWA_GEOGRAPHIC_AREAS.csv` gives each PWSID's
served areas, `AREA_TYPE_CODE = 'CN'` marking a county-served row. That row
carries `ANSI_ENTITY_CODE` -- a real FIPS/ANSI county entity code, preferred
per SPEC over a county-name match -- but it is a bare 3-digit code with no
state attached, and `STATE_SERVED` ("state that the facility is serving",
per EPA's own field description) is **empty on every CN row in the real
2026Q2 download** (verified: 0 of 411,651 county-served rows have it
populated). The state instead comes from `PWSID`'s own two-letter prefix
(EPA's documented PWSID format: "a two-letter state or region code followed
by seven digits"), joined against `raw.sdwis__ref_ansi_areas.STATE_CODE` to
recover the matching `ANSI_STATE_CODE`, which concatenates with
`ANSI_ENTITY_CODE` into a 5-digit county FIPS. `raw.sdwis__ref_ansi_areas`
also catches invalid codes -- verified against the real file: ~5,000
`ANSI_ENTITY_CODE` values (mostly a block of New Jersey rows carrying even
codes like '002', '004', ... where every real NJ county FIPS is odd) do not
correspond to any real county for their state, and PWSID prefixes that are
not a real postal state (numeric EPA-region codes, 'NN' for Navajo Nation,
etc. -- 1,124 of 411,651 rows) cannot be resolved this way at all. Both
kinds are counted, reported (`transform` prints the unmatched rate) and
excluded -- never fuzzy-matched, per SPEC.md. A system serving several
counties counts once in each (verified against real PWSIDs with multiple CN
rows); this over-counts a single violation across a multi-county system's
service area rather than apportioning it, and is called out explicitly here
per the issue's own instruction.

**Why a fourth raw table instead of a hardcoded state-FIPS constant.** A
static `{"CT": "09", ...}` dict would resolve the state half cheaply, but it
cannot also validate `ANSI_ENTITY_CODE` against a real county list -- doing
that would need either landing this same reference data by another name, or
silently trusting whatever 3-digit code the row carries (which is exactly
how the ~5,000 bad New Jersey codes above would turn into wrong FIPS values
read as real ones). Landing EPA's own reference file, from the same zip
under the same licence and version, catches that instead of trusting it.

**Geography vintage: 2010.** `raw.sdwis__ref_ansi_areas` carries Alaska's
pre-2019 Valdez-Cordova Census Area (`02261`) rather than the Chugach
(`02063`)/Copper River (`02066`) census areas that replaced it in 2019, and
Connecticut's eight legacy counties (`09001`-`09015`) rather than the nine
planning regions (`09110`-`09190`) that replaced them in 2022 -- both
verified directly against the real downloaded file. `census_gazetteer.py`
documents the same two markers for its own 2010-vintage file (2020-vintage
carries the post-2019 Alaska areas; CT's planning regions arrive with a
2022-vintage source), so `GEO_VINTAGE = 2010` here matches an already-landed
`geography.unit` vintage rather than inventing a new one.

**No zero-count rows.** Only (county, year) pairs with at least one matched
health-based violation get a row; a county with none in a given year is
absent, not present with `value = 0`. This is a plain count of what the
source reports, not a survey needing an explicit non-response marker, and
there is no complete county-by-vintage universe available here to fill in
against (unlike RUCC, which has one row per FIPS in its own file).

**What is NOT derived, and why.** The issue also asked, "if defensible,"
for a count of active community water systems and the population served by
systems with a health-based violation, per county-year. Neither is: SDWIS's
system-level fields (`PWS_ACTIVITY_CODE`, `POPULATION_SERVED_COUNT`) are a
**current snapshot**, not a per-year history -- SDWA_PUB_WATER_SYSTEMS.csv
carries no historical activity or population column at all. Attaching
today's activity/population to a 2016 violation would misrepresent a
present-day fact as a historical one, the opposite of the derivation this
measure earns by reading violation dates directly. Left out; only the
violation-count measure below is derived.

ponytail: violations before the earliest year Cancer InFocus expects (2016)
or in `quarter`'s own (necessarily incomplete) calendar year are landed in
raw like everything else but excluded from the derived measure -- verified
against the real file that the extract quarter's own year is a fraction of
every prior year's row count (4,967 health-based violations begun in 2026 vs.
32,346-70,695 per prior year), confirming it is a partial year, not that
violations stopped.

ponytail: `SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv` (15,432,737 rows / ~4.1 GB /
~5.1 GB as Arrow in the real 2026Q2 download) fits in memory whole
(measured locally: 1.5s, ~20 GB peak RSS against the local sqlite
warehouse), but is landed in batches anyway -- ported from bioc-on-ice's
`ncbi.py::_land` -- because the production target is R2 Data Catalog, which
rate-limits commits per table and, per that module's own experience, does
not want one multi-GB single-commit overwrite.
