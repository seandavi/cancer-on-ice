"""USDA ERS Rural-Urban Continuum Codes -> Iceberg, in the same two phases as
the other sources.

Upstream: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes
County-level rurality classification (codes 1-9: metro by population size,
nonmetro by urban-population size and adjacency to a metro area), published
per edition. ERS's own product and documentation pages carry no licence
statement (checked 2026-09-18). RUCC is produced by USDA ERS, a federal
agency, as part of employees' official duties, so it is a U.S. Government
work: "Data and content created by government employees within the scope of
their employment are not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17
U.S.C. Sec 105. Government works are by default in the U.S. Public Domain."
(https://resources.data.gov/open-licenses/, checked 2026-09-18).

**Version axis is the edition** (ERS republishes RUCC roughly once a decade:
1974, 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013, 2023), not a retrieval date -- the edition is
in the file name and in the published attribute name (`RUCC_2023`), so it is
a real citable label, landed as `rucc_edition`.

Only the 2023 edition is landed. It is published as a long-format CSV,
verified 2026-09-18 by downloading it: header `FIPS,State,County_Name,
Attribute,Value`, comma-delimited, iso-8859-1 encoded (not UTF-8 -- e.g.
"Do\xf1a Ana County"), one row per (county, attribute) with `Attribute` in
`Population_2020` | `RUCC_2023` | `Description`. 2013 is published only as a
legacy `.xls` (verified 2026-09-18: ERS lists no CSV or `.xlsx` form for it,
only for 2023 and the rolling current file -- `/media/5767/...xlsx` exists
for 2023 alongside the CSV, but 2013's only sibling is `/media/5769/
2013-rural-urban-continuum-codes.xls`). DuckDB cannot read legacy `.xls`
(`excel` extension is `.xlsx`-only) and no new dependency is allowed, so
2013 is left out.

ponytail: 2013 not landed -- no CSV/XLSX form exists upstream and adding an
`.xls` reader is a new dependency. Revisit if ERS ever republishes it, or if
a later source needs pre-2020 rurality and a hand conversion becomes
worthwhile.

**Geography vintage: 2020**, for the 2023 edition. ERS's documentation says
the codes classify counties "based on the 2023 Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) delineation of metro areas," itself built on "2020 Census and
the 2016-20 American Community Survey (ACS)" geography, and that in 2022
"planning regions in Connecticut replaced counties in the Census Bureau's
county-level geography." The downloaded file confirms this directly: it
carries Connecticut's nine 2022 planning regions (FIPS 09110-09190, e.g.
"09110,CT,Capitol Planning Region") rather than the six legacy counties
(09001-09015), and Alaska's current census areas -- Chugach (02063) and
Copper River (02066) -- rather than the pre-2019 Valdez-Cordova (02261) they
replaced. Both are 2020-vintage Census geography markers.

Two American Samoa entities (Rose Island 60030, Swains Island 60040) report
zero 2020 population and carry no `RUCC_2023` attribute row at all --
verified in the downloaded file. That is a missing code, not a suppressed
one; it lands as `value_status = 'not_available'`, never as a number and
never silently dropped.

ponytail: `Population_2020` is landed in raw (it is part of the file) but
not derived into `measure.observation` -- population denominators come from
SEER/ACS elsewhere in the lake, not from RUCC.
