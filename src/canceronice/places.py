"""CDC PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, COUNTY data -> Iceberg.

Model-based small-area estimates for chronic disease, screening and behavioral
risk factors, at (county, measure, stratification-type) grain (SPEC.md §
Sources — first tranche: "model-based tract/county screening & behaviors").

**Licence.** Public domain. The dataset's own Socrata metadata states
`"license": {"name": "Public Domain"}` (checked against
https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/swc5-untb.json, 2026-09-18), attributed to
"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health"; see
also https://www.cdc.gov/places.

**Version axis: the annual release is a separate Socrata dataset.** PLACES
does not version one URL — each year's county file is its own dataset id on
data.cdc.gov, discovered via the Socrata catalog API
(`https://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1?domains=data.cdc.gov&q=PLACES
county data release`, checked 2026-09-18). `RELEASES` records every
long-format "...County Data <year> release" id found that way — NOT the
parallel "County Data (GIS Friendly Format)" datasets, which are wide
(one row per county) rather than the long (one row per county/measure/type)
shape this module wants. `source_release` downstream is the release year
label itself (PLACES publishes no separate release-number scheme).

**The header is not stable across editions.** `COLUMNS` states the CURRENT
shape — verified identical on the 2024 and 2025 releases, the two this module
actually lands (see docstring below) — and lands only those; an older
release fails the header check by design rather than silently mis-landing
(mirrors hgnc.py's dated-archive handling):
  - the 2020 export (`dv4u-3x3q`) has no `LocationID` at all — a `Latitude`
    column holding real latitude text sits in its place, and its point column
    is misspelled `Geolocatioin` — upstream's own defect, confirmed against
    https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dv4u-3x3q.json's column list, not a scrape
    artifact.
  - 2021-2023 lack `TotalPop18plus` (added starting with the 2024 release).
ponytail: only the 2024/2025 header is supported. Landing an older release
means declaring its own COLUMNS first, same as hgnc.py's dated archives.

**Geography vintage moves mid-series.** Connecticut's `LocationID`s are the
legacy 8 counties (09001-09015) through the 2023 release and the 9 planning
regions (09110-09190) from the 2024 release on — verified directly against
each release's real file (PLACES' own methodology notes the 2022 Census
change but not which release picks it up). `GEO_VINTAGE` records 2010 for the
legacy-county releases and 2020 for the planning-region ones, the same two
vintage labels SPEC.md's Milestones use for the pre/post-2022 Census county
definitions.

**Suppression.** The only footnote either landed release carries is
"Estimates suppressed for population less than 50" (0 rows in the 2024
release, 66 in 2025) -> `value_status = 'suppressed_small_count'`.
`FOOTNOTE_STATUS` enumerates it explicitly; any other footnote text raises
`SystemExit` in `transform` rather than guessing.

**No cervix/lung screening measure in county data.** The county file's 40
measures include `COLON_SCREEN` (colorectal) and `MAMMOUSE` (mammography) but
no cervical-cancer-screening measure — BRFSS dropped that module from the
data years this dataset draws on. All 40 measures land and derive regardless
of cancer relevance, per instructions.

ponytail: `TotalPopulation`/`TotalPop18plus` are NOT this measure's
denominator — PLACES publishes model-based prevalence with no published
numerator/denominator pair, only the population the estimate covers. They
land in raw and stay there; `measure.observation.denominator` is NULL.

ponytail: `measure.definition` has no `valid_from`/`valid_to` — it is a
lookup table, not Type-2 versioned (SPEC.md). Interim fix for #76: this
module overwrites only the `measure_id`s it asserts this release
(`And(EqualTo("source", "PLACES"), In("measure_id", ids))`), not the whole
`source = 'PLACES'` scope, so a later release that drops a measure
(`ISOLATION` -> `LONELINESS` in 2025 — same slot, different MeasureId, real
data, checked directly) no longer deletes the earlier definition its still-
live 2024 `measure.observation` rows reference. It does NOT give
measure.definition history: if a `measure_id` that persists across releases
changes its label/universe text, the newer release's text still silently
overwrites the older one in place. The real fix (Type-2 measure.definition,
or another option) is part of #19's versioning decision.

**Tract data (#30), the same house rules extended, not copied.** `TRACT_RELEASES`
records every "...Census Tract Data <year> release" dataset id, found the same way
as `RELEASES` (Socrata catalog API, `q=PLACES Census Tract Data release`, plus a
follow-up query for 2024 specifically since one catalog page missed it; checked
2026-09-18):
    2020 4ai3-zynv, 2021 373s-ayzu, 2022 nw2y-v4gm, 2023 em5e-5hvn,
    2024 ai6z-tcin, 2025 cwsq-ngmh.
Same licence (each dataset's own Socrata metadata: `"license": {"name": "Public
Domain"}`, checked directly on cwsq-ngmh and ai6z-tcin, 2026-09-18).

**The tract header is its own contract, verified against the real files, not
guessed from the county shape.** `TRACT_COLUMNS` is the 2024/2025 tract header —
only these two are landed, same policy as county and for the same reason (2020-2023
lack `TotalPop18plus`, confirmed against each real file's first line). It is NOT
`COLUMNS` plus a `TractFIPS` column: the real tract file has no such column.
`CountyFIPS`/`CountyName` are new (the county file has neither, since it *is* the
county); `LocationID` holds the 11-digit tract FIPS, and — an upstream quirk,
verified against real rows — `LocationName` holds that same 11-digit tract FIPS
again, not a human name, unlike the county file where `LocationName` is the county
name.

**Tract publishes crude prevalence only.** Verified via the Socrata SODA API
against every landed release (`$select=distinct(data_value_type)` on cwsq-ngmh
returns only "Crude prevalence"; `count(distinct(measureid))` is 40, matching
county's measure count). `transform` therefore reuses the *same*
`PLACES:<MeasureId>:crude` ids county's crude rows already assert — tract mints no
measure_ids of its own. To make that safe when both levels feed one `defs` query,
`transform` raises `SystemExit` if county and tract ever disagree on a measure's
label/category/unit text for the same id, rather than silently picking one (they
agree on every id checked: e.g. CSMOKING's `Measure` text is verbatim identical in
both files).

**No suppression in the tract editions actually landed.** Checked directly via the
SODA API (`count(*) where data_value_footnote is not null` and
`where data_value is null`, both 0) against cwsq-ngmh (2025) and ai6z-tcin (2024) —
every one of ~3M rows in each is `reported`. (2020-2022 do have exactly one
unfootnoted-but-null row each — a genuine upstream anomaly — but those releases
aren't landed here anyway.) `FOOTNOTE_STATUS` is still enforced on tract rows via
the same shared `raise SystemExit` path as county, in case a future release
introduces one.

**Geography vintage moves at the same release as county, verified independently
for tract.** Tract count jumps from 72,337 (2023, `em5e-5hvn`) to 83,522 (2024,
`ai6z-tcin`) — consistent with the 2010-vintage (~73k) to 2020-vintage (~85k) tract
count change, not a partial update. Connecticut's `CountyFIPS` values confirm it
directly: 09001-09015 (legacy counties) in the 2023 file, 09110-09190 (planning
regions) in the 2024 file — the identical switch point `GEO_VINTAGE` already
records for county, so tract reuses that same dict rather than a second one.

**Tract files are large: ~2.9M-3.2M rows per release** (2,555,113 in 2023;
3,183,048 in 2024; 3,047,284 in 2025 — SODA `count(*)`), 40 measures x ~72-84k
tracts x crude-only, versus county's few hundred thousand. `land_raw` streams a
remote tract download to a temp file in fixed-size chunks (`_download`) before
DuckDB parses it from disk, rather than handing DuckDB the URL directly the way
the much smaller county file does: the two don't need to hold the whole response
in memory as bytes *and* as an Arrow table at once. Measured against the real 2025
files end to end (`land_raw` + `transform`, county then tract, county's 229,298
raw rows + tract's 3,047,284): peak RSS 15.4 GB, wall clock 15.8s (`/usr/bin/time
-v` on the ingest host, 2026-09-18) — tract's own `land_raw`+`transform` alone
peaks at 10.1 GB in 3s. Comfortably one process's job at that size; not the
71.5M-row scale (25x this) where `bioc-on-ice`'s `ncbi.py::_land` batches reads
and commits — that's the upgrade path if a future tract file's row count grows
into that range, not needed here.

ponytail: tract shares `land_raw`'s county code path via a `level` parameter
(mirrors `cdc_svi.py`'s single `land_raw(..., level=...)`) rather than a second
function, since the only real differences are the dataset-id table, the column
contract, and (tract only) the temp-file download. `transform` similarly derives
from a `raw` view that unions whichever of `raw.places__county` /
`raw.places__tract` are landed for a release (`cdc_svi.py`'s same fix for the same
problem: `measure.observation`'s merge scope is `(source, source_release)`, not
per-level, so deriving from one level alone would retire the other level's rows
landed earlier under the same release).
