"""HRSA Area Health Resources Files (AHRF), county level -> Iceberg.

County-level workforce and facility supply data -- the supply-side context
for a catchment (SPEC.md § Sources -- first tranche). Upstream:
https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/ahrf (topic page) and
https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download?data=AHRF (downloads), annual releases.

**Distribution format, checked 2026-09-18.** The download page's real hrefs
(fetched directly, not summarized) show county-level AHRF as ASCII fixed-width
for 1999-2018, and CSV + SAS + ASCII from the 2022-2023 release on
(`AHRF_CSV_2022-2023.zip`, `AHRF%202023-2024%20CSV.zip`,
`AHRF_2024-2025_CSV.zip`). Only those three CSV-format releases are ever
in scope for this module; earlier fixed-width-only editions are left out.

ponytail: only the current 2024-2025 release is landed. 2022-2023 and
2023-2024 are also CSV-format and could be added the same way RUCC's editions
would be, by declaring their own header/COLUMNS constants first -- not done
here since nothing yet needs the history.

**The CSV zip is one enormous county-row-per-file plus redundant subset
extracts, not several independent thematic files.** Downloaded and inspected
directly: `AHRF_2024-2025_CSV.zip` contains `AHRF2025.csv` (3,235 rows x
4,352 columns -- one row per county/county-equivalent, every field) plus
seven "thematic" files (`env`, `exp`, `geo`, `hf`, `hp`, `pop`, `utl`) that
are column *subsets* of the same master file, for people who only want one
category -- verified column-for-column identical to the master file (a
handful of last-column mismatches turned out to be a CRLF artifact of the
comparison, not real data). Landing the one master file is landing the whole
release; the thematic files add nothing.

## Licence -- this is the load-bearing finding of this module

The topic page states, verbatim: "Usage limitations: None" (checked
2026-09-18, https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/ahrf, rendered
page). That is the generic, page-level claim the issue's `license:cleared`
label was presumably set from.

The release's OWN bundled technical documentation
(`AHRF_USER_TECH_2024-2025.zip` -> `Technical Documentation/AHRF 2024-2025
Technical Documentation.xlsx`, downloaded and opened directly, 2026-09-18)
says something narrower and, for two entire categories of field, contrary:

> "The Area Health Resources Files are made available by the Bureau of
> Health Workforce. Reproduction for re-use or sale is not authorized
> without the expressed permission of the Bureau. Further, data from the
> American Dental Association, the American Hospital Association, and the
> American Medical Association are subject to copyright restrictions; these
> data may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part without the
> prior consent of the copyright owner."

and its own source-abbreviation glossary, in the same file:

> "AHA Survey Database = American Hospital Association Hospital Facilities
> Database (Copyright)"
> "AMA Phys Master File = American Medical Association Physician Master
> File (Copyright)"

The per-field data dictionary in the same document (columns FIELD/CAT/YEAR OF
DATA/VARIABLE NAME/CHARACTERISTICS/SOURCE/DATE ON) names, for every one of
AHRF's 4,352 county columns, which of 45 distinct sources it came from (6
more columns list no source at all). **The gate below is an ALLOWLIST, not a
blocklist**: a column lands only if its source is on `ALLOWED_SOURCES` (or is
one of the 6 no-source structural fields, `NO_SOURCE_LISTED_ALLOWED`) --
anything else is excluded by default, whether this module has a documented
reason for it (`EXCLUDED_SOURCES`) or has simply never seen that source
before (reported by `land_raw`, never landed silently). Every one of the 45
distinct sources in the real 2024-2025 file, checked 2026-09-18:

| Source (as the documentation spells it) | Cols | Verdict | Why |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| AMA Phys Master File | 1815 | EXCLUDED | American Medical Association Physician Masterfile -- glossary-flagged `(Copyright)`; named in the cover-page restriction quoted above. Every physician-specialty count (oncology, radiation oncology, gastroenterology, radiology, dermatology, total M.D.s) is this source. |
| AHA Survey Database 23 | 493 | EXCLUDED | American Hospital Association survey -- `(Copyright)`, same restriction. Every hospital/bed count is this source. |
| AHA Survey Database 22 | 295 | EXCLUDED | as above. |
| ADA Masterfile | 50 | EXCLUDED | American Dental Association Masterfile -- named directly in the cover-page restriction (its glossary entry omits the `(Copyright)` tag the other two carry, but the prose names it all the same). |
| County Health Rankings File | 2 | EXCLUDED | Third party (County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, U Wisconsin PHI / RWJF) -- SPEC.md's Licence gate already lists this source as "Needs review before ingest ... confirm the record's licence", repo-wide and unresolved. |
| System Sciences Study | 1 | EXCLUDED | One 1976-77 elevation field from a private contractor's environmental-mortality study -- no redistribution terms found. |
| DDH,9-33 | 1 | EXCLUDED | One field (`cnty_name`) citing an internal document code not resolved in the documentation's own glossary -- excluded for lack of a verifiable source, not suspected proprietary (the county name is also carried, allowed, as part of `cnty_name_st_abbrev`, "Derived From GSA"). |
| 2019-23 Census ACS | 338 | allowed | U.S. Census Bureau, federal. |
| 2018-22 Census ACS | 338 | allowed | ditto. |
| Census SAHIE | 152 | allowed | ditto (Small Area Health Insurance Estimates). |
| 2010 Census SF1 | 129 | allowed | ditto. |
| 2020 Census DHC | 124 | allowed | ditto. |
| NCHS Mortality File | 88 | allowed | National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/HHS), federal. NCHS's own release policy already suppresses county cells under 10 occurrences before AHRF ever receives the data (confirmed in the AHRF User Guide) -- a publication-threshold policy, not a redistribution restriction; nothing here is `(Copyright)`-tagged. |
| CMS NPI File | 60 | allowed | CMS NPPES provider registry, federal. |
| Census County Char File | 54 | allowed | U.S. Census Bureau, federal. |
| 2020 Census Redistrict | 48 | allowed | ditto (PL 94-171). |
| CMS Marketplace | 44 | allowed | CMS, federal. |
| 2010 Census Redistrict | 42 | allowed | ditto. |
| NCHS Natality File | 42 | allowed | as NCHS Mortality File above. |
| Medicare Geographic Var | 40 | allowed | CMS, federal. |
| CMS Provider of Services | 24 | allowed | CMS, federal (already used for FQHC/RHC/hospice/ASC counts). |
| HRSA DNHSC | 18 | allowed | HRSA, federal. |
| ERS Dept of Agriculture | 16 | allowed | USDA, federal (same source `ers_rucc.py` already treats as public domain). |
| Census Map | 14 | allowed | U.S. Census Bureau, federal. |
| Census SAIPE | 14 | allowed | ditto. |
| Dept of Veterans Affairs | 10 | allowed | federal. |
| OMB-23-01 | 8 | allowed | Office of Management and Budget, federal. |
| HRSA Data Warehouse | 8 | allowed | HRSA, federal (already used for HPSA codes). |
| Census County Pop Est | 8 | allowed | U.S. Census Bureau, federal. |
| Bureau of Labor Stats | 8 | allowed | federal. |
| CMS | 7 | allowed | federal. |
| LAPI | 6 | allowed | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, federal (Local Area Personal Income). |
| CMS Monthly Enroll Dashbrd | 6 | allowed | CMS, federal. |
| CMS MA Penetration | 6 | allowed | CMS, federal. |
| EPA | 6 | allowed | federal. |
| EPA Air Qual Index Rep | 6 | allowed | federal. |
| Derived From GSA | 5 | allowed | General Services Administration, federal -- includes `fips_st_cnty` itself, which becomes raw's `fips` key column rather than a `column_name`/`value` cell. |
| Census Bureau | 4 | allowed | federal. |
| CMS PDP Penetration | 4 | allowed | CMS, federal. |
| CDC EPH Tracking Network | 4 | allowed | federal. |
| NCHS Mort/Nat File | 2 | allowed | a combined mortality/natality-file citation, same NCHS reasoning above. |
| Census SNAP File | 2 | allowed | U.S. Census Bureau, federal. |
| Census Housing Unit File | 2 | allowed | ditto. |
| U.S. Post Office | 1 | allowed | USPS state abbreviations -- standard postal codes, the same ones `census_gazetteer.py`/`ers_rucc.py` already carry unremarked. |
| DHHS | 1 | allowed | federal. |
| *(no source listed)* | 6 | allowed | AHRF's own file-structural fields (`blank`, `date_cretn`, `date_file`, `entity_file`, `file_length`, `st_name`) -- not content from any dataset. |

2,657 excluded + 1,695 allowed = 4,352, the whole header. `raw.hrsa__ahrf` lands
1,694 of the 1,695 allowed columns as `(column_name, value)` cells -- the
1,695th, `fips_st_cnty`, becomes the `fips` key column instead (see the
`Derived From GSA` row). Checked against the real 2024-2025 file
programmatically (not just this table by hand): zero columns fell into the
"unrecognised source" bucket -- every one of the 45 distinct sources above
is accounted for by `ALLOWED_SOURCES` or `EXCLUDED_SOURCES`.

**Consequence for this module, and for the issue that asked for it (#39):**
the issue's requested curated list -- "active MDs, primary-care physicians,
oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, dermatologists, hospitals,
hospital beds" -- is drawn entirely from the AMA/AHA rows above and is NOT
landed here, in raw or derived, under any circumstance (AGENTS.md hard gate:
"License before ingest... license:unknown is a hard stop"; here the finding
is stronger than "unknown" -- it is affirmatively not cleared). What ships
instead is the curated set built from AHRF's genuinely allowed columns (see
`MEASURE_DEFINITIONS` below and the PR description).

The allowed sources above are U.S. government work, public domain per 17
U.S.C. Sec 105 ("Data and content created by government employees within the
scope of their employment are not subject to domestic copyright
protection... Government works are by default in the U.S. Public Domain.",
https://resources.data.gov/open-licenses/) -- the same standing quote the
other sources in this repo cite -- except `U.S. Post Office`, treated as
allowed for the same reason the repo's other sources already carry USPS
state codes unremarked (a standardized, non-creative 2-letter code, not the
Postal Service's copyrightable content). `land_raw` computes the eligible
column set itself, at ingest time, straight from the release's own technical
documentation (see `_classify_columns`), rather than trusting a hand-copied
list to stay in sync with it.

## Landing WHOLE, in LONG form

AHRF is very wide even after the licence gate: 1,694 allowed columns x 3,235
counties. Measured locally against the real file: declaring one NestedField
(with a `doc`, per house rule) for each of ~1,700 columns is not a schema
anyone could review or maintain, and the vast majority would never be read
by anything this repo derives. So raw lands LONG instead -- `(ahrf_release,
file, fips, column_name, value)`, one row per (county, field) cell, verbatim
strings -- which is still landing every eligible cell of the release whole
(SPEC.md ADR-0002's "land raw whole", just at cell rather than wide-row
granularity; ADR-0002 doesn't mandate one physical column per source field,
only that nothing is thrown away or pre-filtered by guessing what will
matter later). Measured: unpivoting the real release takes ~5s and produces
5,480,090 rows locally (1,694 columns x 3,235 counties).

ponytail: because raw is long and every cell is addressed by name rather than
position, this module's header check does NOT reproduce AHRF's 4,352-column
header verbatim the way the other sources' COLUMNS contracts do (that would
be ~100KB of literal column names for no real safety gain here: a reordered
or additional column is harmless to a name-addressed unpivot). Instead
`land_raw` checks that `fips_st_cnty` exists and that every column this
module actually reads (`CURATED_FIELDS`, below) is present and allowed, and
fails loudly naming exactly which ones are not -- the part of "drift" that
would actually break something downstream.

## Version axis and the three time axes (SPEC.md § Versioning)

`source_release` is the release label itself, `"2024-2025"` -- AHRF's own
citable edition name (`method="release_number"`), the same for every row
regardless of which data year a given column describes. `period_start` /
`period_end` come from each column's OWN year suffix instead (e.g.
`hospcs_24` describes 2024, `pers_noins_lt65_pct_21` describes 2021) --
exactly the SPEC.md distinction the issue calls out ("One release carries
many data years: the period comes from each field's year suffix, not the
release"). Getting this backwards (using 2024-2025 as the period) would
silently claim every measure describes the same year, which is false --
`np_npi_24` and `np_npi_23`, both in the SAME 2024-2025 release, describe
different data years AND (see below) different geography.

## Geography vintage: inferred per ROW from the real file, not per column family

AHRF's HPSA fields state no vintage of their own, so this is inferred
directly, as SPEC.md requires when a source doesn't document one. The real
2024-2025 file carries BOTH Connecticut's 8 pre-2022 counties (09001-09015)
AND its 9 post-2022 planning regions (09110-09190) as separate rows in the
SAME file -- and likewise both Alaska's pre-2019 Valdez-Cordova (02261) and
its current Chugach/Copper River census areas (02063/02066) -- verified by
downloading and querying the real CSV directly. Different source families
populate different halves of that split: CMS Provider of Services and HRSA
Data Warehouse fields (FQHC/RHC/hospice/ambulatory-surgery-center counts,
HPSA codes) are non-NULL on the legacy CT counties and NULL on the planning
regions; Census SAHIE and CMS NPI File fields are the reverse. More
tellingly, the split isn't even fixed per source: `np_npi_24` (2024 data)
populates only the 9 planning regions, while `np_npi_23` (2023 data, same
column FAMILY, same release) populates only the 8 legacy counties --
confirming Connecticut's real 2022 transition actually reached this
particular CMS feed between the 2023 and 2024 data years. So geo_vintage
here is a property of which FIPS code a ROW carries, not of which measure or
year produced it: `LEGACY_FIPS` (the pre-2022 CT counties plus
Valdez-Cordova) get `2010`; everything else gets `2020`. This one rule
correctly reproduces every case above without touching source family or
year at all.

## Missing data

Every curated column, checked directly against the real file: a source cell
is either a plain non-negative integer/decimal string, or blank. Blank is
AHRF's only missing marker for these columns (no `.`, `-999`, `*` sentinel
seen) and is mapped to `value_status = 'not_available'`, never a number and
never silently dropped -- a blank cell for a county still gets a raw row
(`value = NULL`) and a `measure.observation` row, because AHRF publishes a
column for every county row; it just leaves some cells empty rather than
omitting the row (unlike RUCC's Rose Island, which omits the row entirely).
A `0` (e.g. Chugach's `fedly_qualfd_hlth_ctr_24 = 0`) is a real reported
zero, never read as missing.
