"""Table- and column-level lineage, captured at ingest with sqlglot (#140).

`provenance.release` says *what* a release was built from; this says *how* a
column got its values, as a DAG over the SQL a module already writes -- no
inference from read/write order (that over-reports: it would claim
`measure.definition <- raw.*` for a table built from Python literals), no
monkeypatching of `duckdb.connect`.

A module opts in explicitly, in three small steps:
  - `connect()` instead of `duckdb.connect()` -- records every SQL statement
    executed (so a CTAS/VIEW intermediate like `combined` or `raw` can be
    resolved) and the local-name -> catalog-table map `load()` builds.
  - `load(con, cat, name, identifier, **scan_kwargs)` instead of
    `con.register(name, cat.load_table(identifier).scan(**kw).to_arrow())`.
  - one `record(cat, release, job, con, outputs)` call at the end of
    `transform`, `outputs` mapping each table it wrote to the exact SQL text
    that produced it. A `raw.*` output maps to the upstream URL instead (the
    DAG's root); an output built in Python rather than SQL (no query at all)
    maps to `None` and gets no lineage, honestly, rather than a guess.

sqlglot's own lineage/scope machinery does the walking (CTEs, subqueries,
CTAS/UNION branches, `SELECT *`); the one thing it can't do is notice that one
UNION branch's literal key column (`measure_id`) belongs with that branch's
`value`/`lower`/... edges -- `_literal_key` does that, small, by hand.

A capture failure never aborts or corrupts an ingest: whatever resolved is
still written, and the unresolved count is printed, not raised.
