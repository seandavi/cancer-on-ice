# Architecture decisions

One file per decision, `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, numbered in the order taken and
never renumbered. A superseded ADR is not deleted or edited into agreement with
the present — it gets a `Superseded by` line and stays, because the reasoning
that turned out wrong is the useful part.

## Inherited decisions

cancerOnIce adopts [biocOnIce's ADRs](https://github.com/seandavi/bioc-on-ice/tree/main/docs/adr)
by reference (SPEC.md § Architecture): land raw then derive (0002), declared
schemas (0003), merge recomputes the scope (0004), the Cloudflare account is
the trust domain (0005), release manifest (0007), bucket-scoped vending tokens
(0011), cdsci-lake as source (0012). An ADR here is needed only where this
domain departs from, or adds to, those.

## What belongs here, and what does not

| | holds |
| --- | --- |
| **SPEC.md** | what the system MUST do — normative behaviour, current and complete |
| **ADRs** | why a decision went the way it did, and what was rejected |
| **milestone tracking issues** | how the work is being found and sequenced |

The test for writing one: would somebody six months from now, or an
architecture review, propose the rejected option again? If yes, write the ADR.

Format: `# NNNN — Title`, `**Status**:`, `## Context`, `## Decision`,
`## Why not <the rejected option>`.

## Status values

`Accepted` · `Superseded by NNNN` · `Reopened` (say by whom and where).
