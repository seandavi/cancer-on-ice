## SEER*Stat

SEER\*Stat cannot connect to the lake, or to anything external — it reads
only its own SEER\*Stat-format databases (`.dic`/state-county-level session
files it manages itself). There is no route where SEER\*Stat is the client
and Catchment Lake is the server. The workflow instead runs the other
direction:

1. In SEER\*Stat, run a rate session (county &times; year &times; site) as
   you normally would.
2. Export the results matrix as delimited text. From NCI's own SEER\*Stat
   help pages (`Matrix Options`, `Rate Statistic Tab`, `Rate Output Tab` —
   see citations below): the export writes a delimited **data** file plus a
   paired **dictionary** file describing it, with format choices (field
   delimiter, whether to include a header) and a "Remove Flags (Footnote),
   Prefix and Suffix Characters" option on the Export dialog. Suppressed or
   footnoted cells (below your session's case-count or population
   threshold) are flagged in the on-screen matrix; **the exact default flag
   character is not stated on the pages this project could reach**
   ([Matrix Options](https://seer.cancer.gov/help/seerstat/seer-stat-basics/results-matrix/features-of-a-results-matrix/matrix-options),
   [Rate Statistic Tab](https://seer.cancer.gov/help/seerstat/rate-session/rate-statistic-tab),
   [Rate Output Tab](https://seer.cancer.gov/help/seerstat/rate-session/rate-output-tab),
   [SEER\*Stat FAQ](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/faq.html)) — confirm it
   against your own export before writing a parser that depends on it.
3. Join the export to the lake in DuckDB or R, by 5-digit county FIPS and
   year — the same "status, never a number" contract the lake itself uses,
   applied to whatever suppression marker your export actually shows.

[`docs/examples/seerstat_synthetic_export.csv`](../examples/seerstat_synthetic_export.csv)
is a **SYNTHETIC** stand-in for step 2 — five Colorado counties, invented
breast cancer counts and rates, two of them suppressed. It is not SEER
data. Because the exact suppression symbol isn't confirmed,
[`docs/examples/seerstat_join.sql`](../examples/seerstat_join.sql) doesn't
hardcode one: it treats any Count/Rate field that fails a numeric cast as
suppressed, whatever character your version uses.

Run against the live catalog:

```
$ duckdb -csv -c ".read docs/examples/seerstat_join.sql"
name,geo_id,year,site,seer_count,seer_age_adj_rate,seer_status,svi_pctile,rucc_code,mammo_screening_pct,mammo_status,n_fqhc

```

(Re-run 2026-09-19 against the live catalog, output unchanged from the run
that shaped this doc.)

Notes:

- **No county-level mammography facility count.** `facility.site` rows of
  kind `mammography` all currently carry `geo_id IS NULL` (not yet
  geocoded to a county) — checked directly against the live catalog
  (`SELECT kind, count(*), count(geo_id) FROM coi.facility.site GROUP BY 1`
  returns 0 non-null `geo_id` for 9,130 `mammography` rows, vs. 19,246 of
  19,246 for `fqhc`). The join above uses the FQHC count per county as an
  access proxy instead.
- **County definitions can drift between SEER\*Stat and the lake.** SEER's
  own county recodes and the lake's Census boundary vintages
  (`geography.unit.vintage`) aren't guaranteed to agree for every county in
  every year; a code that changed (e.g. a rename/recode) resolves through
  `geography.alias` (see [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md)) rather than silently
  failing the join — check there if a county from your export doesn't
  match.
- **SEER Research/Research Plus data carries a per-user data-use
  agreement.** Any real export stays on your own machine. Never upload a
  real SEER\*Stat export here, to the lake, or to any public repository —
  only synthetic or already-public aggregate data belongs in this project.

**The heavier reverse route** — lake extract &rarr; fixed-width file +
SEER\*Prep data dictionary &rarr; a custom SEER\*Stat database you could
open like a native SEER\*Stat session — is not built. It would let an
analyst browse lake data inside SEER\*Stat itself rather than joining
outside it, at the cost of maintaining a SEER\*Prep dictionary alongside
every table's schema; the DuckDB/R join above answers the same question
with far less to maintain.
