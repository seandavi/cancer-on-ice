-- Join a SEER*Stat rate-session export to the Catchment Lake by county FIPS.
--
-- docs/examples/seerstat_synthetic_export.csv is SYNTHETIC: five Colorado
-- counties, invented breast cancer counts/rates for illustration only. It is
-- NOT SEER data. Real SEER*Stat exports are governed by SEER's data-use
-- agreement and must stay on the analyst's own machine -- never uploaded
-- here or to any public repo.
--
-- Run from the repo root:
--   duckdb -c ".read docs/examples/seerstat_join.sql"

INSTALL iceberg; LOAD iceberg;
ATTACH 'canceronice' AS coi (
    TYPE ICEBERG, URI 'https://icegate-canceronice.seandavi.workers.dev', AUTHORIZATION_TYPE 'none'
);

-- 1. Read the export and normalize its county label to the lake's geo_id.
-- SEER*Stat's own "County" attribute text varies by which county variable
-- your session used (County / County recode / State-county recode); this
-- assumes a trailing 5-digit FIPS in parentheses, as this synthetic file
-- has -- adjust the regexp to match whatever your real export shows.
--
-- Suppression: SEER*Stat flags a cell that fails its count/population
-- threshold in the matrix, and the Export dialog can keep or strip that
-- flag character. This script does NOT assume a specific symbol (its docs
-- read for this project did not pin one down -- see docs/CLIENTS.md) --
-- any Count/Rate field that isn't a plain number is treated as suppressed,
-- the same "status, never a number" contract the lake itself uses.
