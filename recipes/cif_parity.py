"""Parity diff between a locally-supplied Cancer InFocus (CIF) national
archive extraction and the cancer-on-ice ("Catchment Lake") public Iceberg
catalog, attached read-only over the anonymous icegate endpoint (see
docs/clients/duckdb-cli.md).

Usage:
    uv run --with duckdb python recipes/cif_parity.py --cif-dir cif/stats --states 08,21

Only prints aggregate comparison stats (n compared, n exact, n within
rounding, n differing + max abs diff, n one-side-only) -- never dumps raw CIF
cell values, so its output is safe to paste into a public report.

**No CIF data is ever committed, stored, or redistributed by this script or
this repo.** It reads a CIF archive from a local path the caller supplies at
run time (the user's own download) and discards it after printing aggregates.
CIF's own `instructions.txt` (https://cancerinfocus.org/public-data/instructions.txt,
checked 2026-09-19) documents exactly this local download-and-read use: "All
of the zip files available on https://cancerinfocus.org are also available
for direct download through https://cancerinfocus.org/public-data ... Sample
code for downloading and unzipping files is posted as
`sample_zip_download_code.R`." No separate terms-of-use or redistribution
notice exists on that download path; distinct from CIF's *gatherer* code
(CIFTools), which is licensed separately and is not used here at all -- this
script only reads CIF's published output files.

ponytail: one flat script, no framework -- this is a one-shot analytical
recipe, not a library. Promote to a scheduled check later if parity needs to
run on a cadence; for now this *is* the runnable check.
